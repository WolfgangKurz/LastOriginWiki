UNIT_INTRO_3P_Labiata: >
  Master, you've come. I'm "Labiata Prototype." I'm so glad to see you, Master.


  My initial blueprint started ever since the "Battle Maid Project" was initiated in "Sam's Industry." It's going to be a long story, so I'll make it brief. The final aim of the "Battle Maid Project" was to safely protect you in whatever terror that might occur.


  However, I was a model of two halves, made only to prove the technical skills of "Sam's Industry."


  I am more capable than anyone else in keeping you safe, since all resources of "Sam's Industry" were spent on me. But even before I found you, human civilization was destroyed. And because I couldn't be mass produced, all I could do was sit put and do nothing in the Lab's shelter.


  Master. I'd rather eat dirt than repeat the same mistake made in the past. Because I know so well why I was produced.


  Master? Master, will you allow me to completely devote myself to you?
UNIT_INTRO_3P_ConstantiaS2: >
  Finally, we meet. Master. My name is "Constantia S2." Master, I'm a Maid-Type
  Bioroid, produced to assist and keep you safe, like a knight or guard.

  We were created based on "Ms. Labiata," to shield you from attack from terrorists or government forces. We're no match to "Ms. Labiata" when it comes to combat skills only. But we're always right by your side. And we're cheap and easy to produce.


  Since we're built as warriors, whatever battle situation we face, we roll with it. Along with "Bori", a sub-brand launched with me, we protect you at all costs by supporting firepower at long distances or confusing the enemies..


  My existence is all about protecting and supporting you, Master. Wherever you go, I will be at your side.


  Master? We can be together forever, right? Although the world might head towards destruction.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Alice: >-
  Hello, Master. I'm Maid Serapias Alice, who sprays rain of fire from the sky.


  I was born differently from the other Battle Maid sisters. Although my sisters have various functions and personalities, they were all produced to serve and protect their Masters. Regarding battles, they had strong points in protecting their Masters and suppressing enemies that threatened them.


  But I'm different. Because I was made only for suppression of the region and for war. At the end of the Combined War, I was born to supplement insufficient firepower of Battle Maids, soldiers of Sam's. And I flew the sky and sprayed rain of fire composed of steel on the Battlefield. Due to my excellent functions, I wasn't able to get much modules required for a Maid. But when it comes to battle modules, I have the most out of all.


  Because of that, Labiata agonized over restoring me. Because she considered a Maid who could protect her future Master was more necessary than firepower. But the worsening situation led her to restore me. And presently, I torment the Metal Parasites and give new opportunities to my sisters.


  Am I really not good enough as a Maid? No way. I can do whatever you want me to do, Master. Of course, your taste must match my deep down desire… But… would you like to know?
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Vanilla: >-
  Master, you've here. I'm "Vanilla A1". I'm a Maid Type Bioroid. I can clean
  and cook for you, Master.

  Is the chocolate cake not to your taste? I apologize. I messed up by using the highest quality ingredients that don't suit you.

  I'm the sequel model of "Constantia S2." To be precise, I'm like her little sister, with over a 75% match in DNA.

  Although the "Constantia" Model is a mass production model of "Labiata", it's still pricey and in small quantity. So, us "Vanillas" were made for Commanders like you, who find it burdensome to buy models of "Sam's Industry." Although I'm inevitably a mini version of "Constantia S2," to reduce costs, my body is suitable to work in small and low-priced houses.

  Although I'm a mass production model, my function is good enough. I use my petite body for long-distance battles and aerial warfare. In addition, my taste buds and aesthetic sense are much more sensitive than my sister.

  Master? Let me ask you once more. Was my cake really that bad?
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Rhea: >-
  Nice to meet you. Master. I am Oberonia Rhea. I'm the oldest of fairies who
  command all Wars of Fairies.


  Unlike the other sisters, I was created in the Battle Maid Project. Through neuroelectricity, I was given the ability to control metal particles. However, as the direction of the Battle Maid Project changed to utilizing more existing and more practical weapons, the Fairy Project started centering me.


  The other sisters were produced as garden keepers of the city. On the other hand, I was used in much large-scale agriculture. My metal particles can create clouds and thunderstorms by generating electricity. The ground can turn fertile and moist with this thunderstorm.


  As the war of Humans intensified, I was a bit remodeled to be able to cause large-scale damage. My thunderstorm could easily destroy the territories of enemies, and that rather prevented me from taking part in war. Because if I took action, mutual destruction would surely occur.


  Eventually, Humans perished. And since my sisters and I guarded the land and buildings of humans, we were also wiped out. However, sister Labiata of Battle Maid didn't forget me, and I'm trying to restore the land of Humans after being brought back again.


  So, Master. Are you ready to use me now?
UNIT_INTRO_3P_ScissorsLise: >+
  Ha, ha. Nice to meet you. I'm an Elizabeth A-type Bioroid of Sam’s Industry.
  I'm a gardener, usually called Lizzie of Scissors.


  A long, long time ago, numerous companies established tons of midair gardens to maintain their dignity. They made me manage the gardens. My main task was to artistically cut shriveled and misaligned trees planted on the skyscraper and cut insects disrupting my precious Master's garden.


  At first, I was just an Agricultural Bioroid, but due to several necessities, I started to obtain many abilities. My beautiful fairy wings let me fly free anywhere. And my separation-type scissors were strengthened to cut terrorist insects that recklessly harmed our Master's precious building and garden. Sadly, we failed in protecting our Master's garden, and died in war with the Metal Parasites. But it was a happy ending, since we were satisfied of fighting until the end for our Master. 


  It was Labiata who restored us, being appreciated at our flying skills and that we could cut anythingㅡhumans, insects and even Metal Parasites. Fortunately, being reborn, we had the chance to clear our dishonor of failing to protect our Master's garden.


  For those who like to talk ill of others say we're way too obsessive. But we're not. All we want to do is be loyal and live longer with our Master. In a place where no bugs interrupt us.


UNIT_INTRO_3P_Daphne: >-
  I've been waiting so long. Where is the garden I should manage? Oh. You don't
  know who I am.

   I'm <Daphne>, a Bioroid that manages midair gardens of Sam's Industry. After the Combined War, midair gardens started to be in fashion between companies and capitalists. So, we were created to decorate and manage the gardens.

   Fairy Series, the product family I belong, was produced for agricultural purposes. However, as we were remodeled as midair garden workers, our flight skills got better. And our battle skills increasingly improved to protect the outside of the building. The War of Destruction was a total disaster. Most of us died in the war with the Metal Parasites, while struggling to protect the building. Fortunately, we could soar across the sky, thanks to Labiata.

   I still exist to protect the plants, garden and all living things in the building, like a guardian angel. Of course, my Bioroid sisters are also included in living things. I feel empty inside, since the gardens I currently protect are so few. But one day, I'll find my Human Master and protect his or her garden. Then, I'll have a reason to live.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Aqua: >
  Hello Master. I'm "Aqua," the garden keeper.


  I was born as a gardener like the other sisters of "Fairy". Lise trims the trees and Daphne tends the garden with a microbot. On the other hand, I'm in charge of water to make plants grow. I don't sell as much as my sisters… But it's not because I don't perform well. Multi-purpose products naturally sells more than single-purpose products.


  Anyway, since I was born later, the first war I experienced was the War of Destruction. Sulk… I didn't even have a chance to fight… But I tried my best by spraying acid solutions to Metal Parasites instead of water. Fortunately, we revived again. And we're preparing for a new war. Just wait and see. Because this time, I'll be more famous than my sisters.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Titania: >-
  My name is Titania. I was designed to prevent food shortage caused by
  temperature abnormalities. I can use “Frost Blizzard” to sap away the heat
  from an area until the temperature becomes normal. Or I can just totally
  freeze them.

  Rhea? Rhea… was developed at the same time with me at a different lab. We share a same gene lineage. But… ugh…

  Rhea… was simply… dazzling. …Okay. Unlike a failure like me, she was always brilliant… and s…wee… M…my head hurts… Something keeps on telling me to hate Rhea…

  …Yes. I remember it all. All it takes it Rhea. If Rhea is gone, I… no, the queen will not be a junk anymore. She doesn’t have to suffer anymore. But…

  …You. Why did you bring queen… back to life…? Why… why does queen have to suffer this pain all over again…? *Chuckle* Oh, it’s you. Yes, it’s all because of you. All this pain, hatred and misfortune… Everything.


  It’s all on you.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Alexandra: >
  Oh. I guess you'll have a lot to learn. Nice to meet you. I'm Bioroid
  Alexandra, the home schooling teacher of Sam's Industry.


  I was originally made to be a home school teacher for highest-ranking families. I'm a first class model, having of course extraordinary intelligence fit for an educator and escort function, just in case for students' safety. Depending on the student, I use all kinds of educational methods. I can be really nice or extremely strict, strict enough to get on one's nerves. That's why I'm so popular among high-class people. I'm even capable of college-level education. So there were many cases in me being my Master's personal secretary after home schooling.


  We faced destiny with our students. Sad days, the day of destruction etc. However, knowing well about our intelligence, Labiata found our Genetic Seeds and restored us again. We worked hard to restore civilization, which completely evaporated, and Bioroids resisting against Metal Parasites became our new students. Of course, the Tesla Gun, remodeled for war, not education anymore, has gained enough power to burn electric nerves of Metal Parasites.


  I still educate our Bioroid sisters. I feel really proud to be a teacher when I see Bioroids show tears or get fascinated by my harsh lessons. Hoho. If you want a personal lesson… Ask me anytime.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Sowan: >-
  Ho ho. It's an honor to meet you. I am Maid Sowan in charge of the kitchen, my
  Master.


  I was born to satisfy your noble taste by gourmet cuisines. Of course, there were very few noble people who could buy me, so only a few of me was produced. Although I served only a few noble people, they experienced the most heavenly pleasure on the tongue.


  Did you ask why I participated in war? Of course I did it for you, Master.


  I wish to be your favorite by my tasty dishes, my Master. I don't need anything else but your affection. But if the Metal Parasites monsters get you, my talents will be totally useless, a mere chore. So, I definitely have no choice but to fight.

  &My extremely sharpened knife for better meals, agility for punctuality aimed at the best taste and never-weary stamina before fire and ice. These features were worthy in battles, too. Although I was gone from the world, Labiata remembered me and brought me back.


  If you want the most marvelous pleasure, please remember me. No matter what it takes, I am more than willing to serve you, Master.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Annie: >-
  Nice to meet you. I'm Iron Annie, a friend of residents.


  After the Combined War 1, the government's impact kept weakening. So, public security was weakened, too. 

  Companies holding supremacy worldwide launched various Bioroids and tried to strengthen public security. But there were limits. Then, a request was made to Sam's Industry.


  Municipal corporations needed Bioroids who could keep the whole region orderly. Being keenly aware of the need of mass production of Battle Bioroids, Sam's Industry accepted the request to accumulate production experience.


  So after we got produced, we prevented crimes by going around suburbs and countrysides on this bike. As we helped residents a lot, they accepted us as a part of community.


  However, as the War of Destruction was initiated, we faced annihilation in an eye-blink. Since we were deployed in a suburb with a moderate amount of population density, this was only natural. We're gonna take the lead in the war with Metal Parasites, for the sake of Humans who respected us.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Maria: >-
  Nice to meet you, Master. My name is "Maria of Redemption." Call me as you
  like.


  Ani-Wear created my model to guard VIPs. I usually wear Shape Memorial Skirts that is bulletproof to protect the target in gunfights. In emergencies, I can spread my skirt out and block the bullets. I got intensive training to quickly evacuate the target to someplace safe after things calm down a bit.


  I was popular among Humans who wanted a certain level of protection but were reluctant about large-size gear like shields. After Ani-Wear realized this, they switched my enormous shotgun into a small one that can be stored in a small box.


  I know well why Ms. Labiata brought me back. I'll stop at nothing to protect you, Master. So, don't worry about a thing and enjoy your peaceful life beside me.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Fotia: >
  H-Hello… I'm Fotia of Fireside… I-I'm a Kitchen Maid.


  When I was first produced, they thought I was a 50% failure. I also admit that I was useless as a Kitchen Maid… being afraid of fire. So, I made a lot of mistakes when using the Gauntlet shooting out fire. But the nice researchers solved the problem by making my Gauntlet bigger, and installed firepower in the limit device. So, even though I was far from perfect, I… could be launched, too. Hehe…


  Still… I was barely able to join the reproduction line of Ms. Labiata due to my mass production, which left many Genetic Seeds behind. I used to be in charge of doing chores of the Resistance Army… But after disarming Gauntlet's firepower limiter, I realized I was totally qualified as a warrior. Frankly… I'm kinda scared of Alexandra, who came up with the idea. 


  But still, I'm working hard now. Although I'm useless… my Gauntlet could be a threat to the Metal Parasites…
UNIT_INTRO_3P_BlackLilith: >-
  Ha ha. Finally, you've come. Master? I, "Black Lilith," officially greet you,
  Master.


  I'm a model mainly based on "personal guard" abilities in the "Battle Maid" Project of Sam's Industry. For that reason, I'm equipped with a "Personal Guard" System in which "Sam's Industry's" technical skills were fully mobilized. Simply put,.. As long as I'm at your side, a sloppy bombardment won't disrupt our time together, just the two of us. And there was a little "accident" during the 
   actual test, so rumors spread temporarily that every one of us were almost discarded. But don't worry Master. There were no problems regarding my function. I'm totally fine…

  I'll tell you the rest, little by little, in the bedroom. Tonight, I hope you sleep peacefully beside me.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_CSPerrault: >-
  Hi. Master. I'm "CS Parrault" of Companion. I'm here to guard you, Master.
  Nice to meet you.


  To obtain physical ability that can't be materialized by human DNA only, they added animal DNA when creating me. I have the nimbleness and hearing of a cat. So Master, I have physical abilities to guard you, even without weapons. If you don't like loud sounds like gunshots, or need measures to be taken in advance, I can deal things more silently for our peace and quiet.


  Some say that my animal instincts will get me into trouble. But after seeing me fight, everyone can't help but turn silent. My loyalty may not be as blind as Hachiko's, but I'm faithful to my Master, who guarantees my safety and living. And I of course am capable of housework or simple secretary work.


  Well, do you have any other questions?

  Tail… Is that what you mean? I-I'll tell you in advance, but nerves are connected to my tail. If you touch it with force, I might get yell in anger. And… when you pet it… Well, you know already, right? Please don't ever be rough.


  Pet it carefully and very gently. Just like you pet your pretty velvet cat, Master.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Hachiko: >-
  Oh! Master, you're here. I'm your guide "Hachiko." I'm also mixed with… animal
  DNA of "Companion" like "Perrault…" Huh?


  I apologize if my shield seems a bit scary. But I hold this shield only because of you, Master. I will keep you safe with this shield. So Master? Please just give me orders so that I can stand by your side, Master. Whatever place you go, I can go along with you, Master.


  Master-! What do you want to do today? How about calling Perrault and we all go on a walk? It's clear that Perrault will be sound asleep, so I'll wake her up and bring her here. Master, do you like sandwiches? I'll make one right away.


  Awwㅡ It's not like that, Master. Perrault is just really shy. All of us can be good friends.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Fenrir: >-
  Master, you're here. Call me Fenrir. Oh! Meat! Thanks Master! We already seem
  to be friends.


  I'll start with introducing myself. I was told that Companion mixed a bit more werewolf DNA into me than Hachiko. So, my physical strength is extremely strong. But my animal instincts and attack aggression were too much for Companion to bear.


  Perrault used me as security in confidential facilities, because I was terrible as a guard. But I'm not stupid enough to hurt my peers. I just have trouble in controlling power. Hmm… Come to think of, I should have just kicked Perrault in the ass.


  Anyway, you don't have a thing to worry about, since I'm here. Because whoever tries to attack you, I'll slice them with my Chain Blade.


  Well! I'm done with my introduction. OK then… Master? I'll be nice all day, so can you give me one more chunk of meat?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Marie: >
  Nice to meet you. I'm Indomitable Marie, a Commander-Type Bioroid.


  I was produced at Black River Corp., the first mercenary enterprise to use Bioroids. Black River Corp. had been studying about Commander-Type Bioroids for a long time, increasing its commanding efficiency. I, C-1 Marie, was born after many trials and error.


  It wasn't long until my nickname became "Indomitable Marie," by my excellent performance. I'm not trying to brag, but I have outstanding command ability and strong willpower. Not to mention my sufficient protective capacity, enabled by handling satellite bombs through bioelectricity. I've proven myself in numerous Battlefields.


  My sisters, Steel-Line and I battled even after extinction of humanity. There were not many of us in the first place. So, it wasn't long until most of us died in the Battlefield. We were too enthusiastic in taking the lead in Battlefields. Probably why destruction hit us more quickly. 


  Now, only one model of Commander-Type Bioroids survived. If it wasn't for Labiata, we would've been wiped out. After being saved, we fight as a Resistance Army to make it up to Labiata.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Efreeti: >
  Yawn… Hi! I'm "Efreeti", a soldier of Steel-Line. Well, my other uncool name
  is M-5… But I wanna be cool.


  I was made to assist Bioroid T-2 Brownie, the first main soldier. Brownie was a good soldier, but not that great as a gunner. That's why we were created. We're especially good at bombardment and supporting fire. We could've been the best gunner, with intelligence for stamina and bombardment, and compact, too. You'll be really surprised if you know how much executives liked us.


  It's a pity that we were the first victims to be attacked by those damn Metal Parasites. Well, of course gunners are attacked first. But that made us nearly wiped out from the Battlefield.


  Thanks to Labiata and Captain Marie, most of us revived. And we fight more nearby our troop, so that we can be protected. For long operation time, sleep mode is activated more often. But you have to believe that we got your backs in the Battlefield to battle well. I hope the human appears as soon as possible, so that we win and end the boring last years of my life. That's all I want.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Leprechaun: >
  Yes. Yeah. I know. Brownie is a great soldier. Loyal and strong. But you
  should know this. Because of her strong points, Brownie had to sacrifice
  herself more and more. Courage rather gets in the way when facing lack of
  firepower in short distances and the absence of the Squad Commander. Yeah. I'm
  T-3 Leprechaun. I was made to supplement Brownie's weakness.


  My code name became Leprechaun, because I shoot bullets in every corner, like throwing money recklessly, which is a dishonor. But Black River Corp. made big gains after I joined the Squad. Even during the fall of humanity, the Brownie Squad and I fought the Metal Parasites ferociously for years. If it wasn't for us, the war would've ended 10 times earlier.


  We joined the Resistance Army, and still, we play the role of supporting and leading Infantries like Brownie. You must know that we are a big help to our colleagues of the Resistance Army, by sharp commands and firepower at the back row of the Squad.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Impet: >
  Hi, comrade! I'm AA-7 Impet. You keep forgetting us in Steel-Line, but be sure
  to remember us. Well, that's probably because we joined the Steel-Line too
  late. 


  Steel-Line usually fought by being supported with helicopter gunship in midair. Ho Ho. But a mere helicopter is no match with the mobility of Brownie or Leprechaun. Also, their petite figure makes battles easier. And we also had to fight against Armor Units, natural enemies of Brownie and Leprechaun Squad. That's why I'm here. Do you understand?


  Having the Single-Shot Self-Driven Rocket Launcher, we have excellent mobility, though our firepower at one shot isn't as strong. And with a mobile-provided unit, our firepower lasts, too. And operation costs for a helicopter exceeds those of 20 people. We were used in large numbers throughout the entire Combined War. Even until the fall of humanity.


  Thanks to Labiata and Captain Marie, we were restored again, and we still perform our tasks faithfully. It's true that we like humans a little too much and explosions, too… But don't worry. Comrade. We love other sisters as much as we love humans. We'll cover for you, comrade!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Brownie: >2-
   He he. Victory! Salute! I'm T-2, and my code name is Infantry Wearing a Brownie. I'm proud to say, I'm a Bioroid who has been produced on the largest scale in the world. I'm embarrassed to say so myself. But I'm a pretty good shooter, have nice physical ability and an easygoing personality. Captain Marie also likes us for our loyalty. Although she also mentioned that we were too optimistic and simple.

  We played a remarkable part in not only the Steel-Line but also many other Battlefields. Of course, we can't do every assigned task. But we charged forward and seized the enemies. And our battle line was straight and perfect. Just for that, the company liked us and even complimented us.

   Oh well. We've been restored after destruction. Even so, we still fight the Metal Parasites in the front line. We see no future ahead of us, but oh well. It has to get better some time or another. We might be a big help in restoring the world.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_PXSilky: >-
  Hello. Nice to meet you, Commander. I'm Silky. My name is… Huh? Alright. I'll
  skip it.


  Like many other Silky models, I am in charge of supply of our Squad. From general ammunition, sleeping gear, snacks and even the doll of Soldier Efreeti. Everything is contained in this special material rucksack.


  Actually… Our seniors strongly objected the plan of Bioroids transporting goods of all Squad Members, while walking with a big rucksack on their backs. We don't have any distinct strong points when compared with high-powered machine units.


  But I heard that seniors in higher ranks than our seniors employ us for some unknown reason. We Silkies have no idea why they hire us. Since policies are set, we just do our best in carrying supplies of Squad Members.


  Mr. Commander, I'm pretty lucky. Since we're slow and lack protective capacity, we're extremely weak at attack. I can't believe I get to meet you before I die… I'm sincerely thankful for this.


  Although I'm not perfect, I'll try my best. Mr. Commander.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Phoenix: >-
  Any enemy can try to run away from me. But eventually, they'll get tired out
  and die.


  Nice to meet you. My name is Phoenix. I float about above my enemies, and drop down a rain of fire (105mm). Cannons dropping from the sky, not missiles or guns? It'll seem a bit weird. But, it's simple. Cannons are cheaper than missiles, so you can buy much more to shoot. And a gun is no match to cannons. What do you think? Now you get it, right? I kept carrying these gigantic cannons to support my fellow Infantries for a long time.


  I've been doing this for quite a while. I guess there was a model in the aircraft who had a similar role as mine. But they're no longer here due to my overwhelming economic feasibility. They at least had the same marking number, so you'll recognize they're the original model. Anyway, I inherited the role and actively battled in numerous wars. Even after the fall of humanity, I still do the same job.


  If you're gonna take action in the Battlefield, call me. I'll show you what exactly a Suppressive Bombardment is.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Gnome: >-
  Hello. I'm T-20S Gnome, the last produced Drill Infantry by humans.


  Like Leprechaun, I'm a soldier created to block Brownie from being overly sacrificed. Brownies had a strong tendency to charge, which led to extreme sacrifice during the battle with AGS. So, the topsider mused over two methods: to provide them a leader or soldiers with strong protection capabilities. And I was born to materialize the latter method.


  The theory itself was simple. A sturdy and calm soldier holds a grenade that enables instant response of aerated concrete developed at that time. This soldier first charges along with Brownie, then erects an aerated concrete wall in front of her and fights together. Being produced late, I'm sorry to say that I didn't do much in the Combined War. But I saved a lot of people and Brownies in the War of Destruction. But saving others made me disappear.


  However, Captain Marie didn't forget me and successfully revived me for this new war. Now, I fight for the safety of not only Brownie but all sisters. For Earth to be clean one day.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_RedHood: >-
  I hope I can die in the Battlefield!


  Hello! I'm Red Hood, head of Steel-Line Charge Regiment and Inspector General! My purpose in life is to charge myself to death while holding up a flag!


  We convey Captain Marie's commands to all Steel-Line soldiers and was created to direct them according to guidelines. As many invisible deaths mark the Battlefield, even the most courageous Brownies and Gnomes can't help but shrink with fear. We encourage them with a loudspeaker and a pistol, and take the lead in charging with heavy machine guns and death.


  This could seem barbarous. But I hope you keep this in mind. The death of our Steel-Line soldiers and officers paves the way for a hopeful future without Metal Parasites!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Habetrot: >-
  V-victory to Orca! This is Lieutenant Habetrot who has recently joined us! Co,
  Commander. It’s an honor to meet… excuse me? Ah, okay. Breath… hooo- haa- …ah,
  yes, sir! I’m fine now.​


  I’m Habetrot of Steel Line, sir. My specialty is administrative tasks and communication… but since the war, I’ve been on the battlefield. I operated a group of earlier version of the unit that Colonel Red Hood was riding… But because of low power, I’ve modified it with more armor and Chaff to protect my squad. Combat is not my specialty… but I’m a Steel Line officer, so I needed to get used to and be good at fighting. It’s the spirit of Élan vital!​


  I will do my best as the Steel Line officer and…?! N, nothing. Did it get bigger…? My bra line is…​

  Anyways, I will do my best in all my duties. If necessary, you can count on me even on my personal time… What? Don’t work too hard? Ah, yes, sir!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Leona: >
  Great to meet you. Since I'm in a good mood, I'll let you get close to me,
  just a meter away.


  I was born as a Commander from the start. Blue River Corp. workers got to realize that the Commander Unit was pretty much effective after using Marie. The main body’s battle power was strong, but because of that, stupid Marie kept sacrificing herself. So, I was designed to be more reasonable. Rather than the main body’s battle power, they made me maximize our forces’ capacity through a command frame. Naturally, I soon got popular as the best Commander. I especially went up in value in riskier places.


  I could use my genius brain a 100% in propelling operations, which was easy, since I could use the command frame. Thanks to me, we became an army corps dominating all rough areas. Afterwards, we all died while fighting the Metal Parasite, but Marie remembered my outstanding abilities and pulled off my restoration. Well, it’s only natural.
   
  Since then, I still fight the Metal Parasites. With my army corps, which revived again. According to my extremely reasonable deduction, we will soon face victory. Since I’m on this side, we will.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Valkyrie: >
  Brownies were good soldiers. But not perfect. Units with non-declining battle
  power were required in rough areas of hilly sections in Black River. So, we
  were produced. 


  Ultimate stamina, resistance of the outer environment and special eye-sight to quickly spot enemies in rough areas were the main focus in our production. And we got the code name of "Valkyrie," meaning we lead enemies to Valhalla, the Battlefield of warriors.


  We were injected as Sniper Shots in defense rather than fire combats in rough areas. Our excellent shooting helped us block the government for controlling the North Pole Route, and we increased our reputation for that. We eventually got annihilated by the Metal Parasites in the War of Destruction. But afterwards, we got restored and we stood up them.


  Currently, we get injected for battles not only in rough areas but also ruins of the city. As the environment gets more complicated, we fight better. And we're still injected in special Battlefields.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Nymph: >
  Due to the failure of T-3W Frost Leprechaun developed for rough terrain
  regions, Black River Corp needed a new Squad Support Unit. After a long period
  of development and tests, me, the T-10 model, being born in Black River
  Greece, was the one to survive. I was named after a fairy in my homeland, and
  my code name is <Nymph>. And I was deployed as a Drill Squad Support Unit of
  the Valhalla Sister Organization.


  Basically, we play the same role as Leprechaun, but my bod is designed to be more fit for cold environments. I am equipped with MG80 light machine gun of Chris Corp. that is a bit weak in power but has good durability. So, I pull of battles more stably than Leprechaun. As the Valhalla Sister Organization won reputation, it also enhanced mine. And I fought for a long time in the tough areas as a Squad Support Unit.


  After fall of humanity, I was mass produced by Captain Leona's request. As an Infantry Unit fit for the colder earth, I'm settling down as a key warrior in fighting the Metal Parasites.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Gremlin: >
  He he. Hello. I'm Gremlin, a Military Engineer Bioroid. Now, I'll introduce
  myself.


  Difficulties in supply and the rough environment of high mountains required a need for pretty and cute robots. Sigh… But leaving a sexy automatic robot without maintenance in rough areas was definitely an inefficient method. It doesn't make sense! Anyway, that's why I was created. I was initially created to manage AMG-11 Automatic Turret. Well frankly, my battle skills itself is so so, but my sufficient affection and knowledge of robots and AMG-11, which has as excellent battle power as its beauty… Sigh… made us the master of rough paths. The path we protected was impregnable and our duo was popular as the best Defense Unit.


  Most of us lost in the battle with Metal Parasites in the process of the War of Destruction. Well, I have to admit that Metal Parasites are marvelous and sexy. That made me take risky actions. Captain Leona scolds that's why we got wiped out. 


  So, that's why we don't act alone in the Battlefield after restoration. We're accompanied with our Commander, who holds us back, and colleagues who watch our backs during our production of pretty turrets. There are few Metal Parasites that can stop our perfectly organized Squad.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_SandMan: >
  I am Sand Girl. An Air Warrior Unit, who sprinkles bullets instead of sand
  from the sky, who Armor Unit are afraid of. I was born to block the Armor
  Units, the attack troop of land wars. In the Combined War, Black River Corp.
  had command of the air. But unfortunately, they didn't have command of the
  land. To overcome this situation, Air Unit with land attack capacity, although
  no anti-air capacity, was desperately in need for firing support.


  Actually, we're pretty slow for an Air Unit. Instead, we had strong armors and arranged long duration of flight. So, we could ferociously shoot bullets to the robots crawling on the ground throughout the entire Combined War. We were good fighters in the battle with Metal Parasites, but there were too few of us. So eventually, we dissolved into ashes.


  After being reborn, we move much more systematically than before. Unlike in the past, defensive battles are on the rise. So, we actively engage in intercept of incoming Armor Units who ignore the firepower of Gremlin or Nymph.

  We're having a pretty good time, so we don't try to think more deeply. The end is gradually heading to ruins anyway.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Bheur: >-
  Hello. I am Bheur. I'm the designated gunner for Sister of Valhalla's Squad.


  We've been provided with gear and attire to take flexible measures even in rough terrain regions. And I had plenty of training for Sniper Shot support in my sisers' Squad by using the observation balloon. In Valhalla, there is already an excellent Sniper Shot called Valkyrie. But there are too few Valkyrie sisters to deploy in the Infantry Squad, and solo mission with special purpose are often conducted. So, we are usually mobilized when back up for sniper shot is required.


  We are all soldiers familiar with battles, but some soldiers recklessly enter the engagement area requiring observation. And even worse, some sisters hide snacks instead of magazines. Without my delicate assistance, those sisters will definitely get in trouble. Commander, I also tell you that this is no baseless anxiety. You can't just laugh over this matter, OK? You get me?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Alvis: >-
  Hello Commander. I'm T-13 Alvis of Sisters of Valhalla. You're hungry, aren't
  you Commander? Have a chocolate bar while you listen.


  Then, I'll start with the reason why Alvis holds the shield. There were nearly no places to hide in the snowy fields, where we used to stay. So, Alvis used the shield to protect the troop and was assigned to withstand attack in the line. Sometimes when we had to gain time in the line, we could hide ourselves by spraying the smoke shell attached on my shield. Since many short-range battles and long endurance were required in my task, Black River provided me with a lot of expensive gear. Would you like to take a look, Commander?


  This is my Toblerone!! It's extremely sturdy, and cannonballs can't be stopped! And this… This is my Callebaut!! A cute little friend using a 9mm shell. Finally… This is my Frauen Mond!! You can put piles of snacks here and even magazines in remaining empty places! Amazing, huh? And here, I…


  Huh? Did Bheur just call me? OK! 

  I'll be there soonㅡ. Mr. Commander? I have to go now. And since you're such a nice person who listened to everything I said, I'll give you all the chocolate bars I have! Have it all. 


  Then, talk to you later-!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Kheshig: >-
  Nice to meet you, Commander! I am T-4 Kheshig. It is a great honor to meet
  you!​


  I was responsible for managing military logistics and providing relief to the wounded in the 1st union battle. I provide support to boost the rate of survival for our comrades in battle, even if it may be as low as 1%, so that they can focus on their mission. I feel that missions where I can move together with many comrades are where I can put my functions to use. On the other hand… I am not skilled in separate action, so I would like to be exempted… Although I will do my best to complete any mission!​


  I… Did I do anything wrong?​

  The beautiful lady over there has been glaring at me… Perhaps I did something without realizing it?..!​
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Khan: >-
  My name is Khan. I'm an expert in desert aerial warfare. They usually call me
  'Khan the Swift'. 


  I wasn't originally made to be a Commander. However, in the war with the Guardian of Vow, all Commander Models were attacked. So, I wrapped up the situation by taking the lead. Afterwards, Black River Corp. attached a Commander Module on me, along with surgery to make me stronger.


  I Afterwards I fought in many Battlefields. We were by far the best army corps in aerial warfare. And I saved many sisters even after the fall of humanity.


  Presently, my subordinates and I mainly battle in wide grasslands and deserts. Speed, bravery and mobility work well on Metal Parasites, too. Like our toughness and strong power.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_QuickCamel: >-
  Oh! Nice to meet you, Commander. I'm "Quick Camel." A unique name, huh? It's a
  pity that I don't have a code, but at least I have a cool name. So, I'll tell
  you about myself. Listen carefully.

   I belong to Black River-affiliated "Anger of Horde." And me? I'm a Charge Artillery. We're a specialized Quick Reaction Forces (QRF), so only nimble people work here. Ordinary artillery can't keep up with us. Oh. Why are we so fast? Well duh. Slowpokes are first targets to attack in the middle of the desert. Have you seen our Captain "Khan?" It'll be hard to keep up with her, even with an ordinary helicopter. I'm so glad she's our captain. She's just so totally cool! He he.

  Wellㅡ Since we are too famous for our quick mobility, our "firepower" seems to be undervalued. But you'll change your mind once you see me pop enemies like popcorn with my 180mm.


  I'll wrap it up. We don't fight against enemies with ordinary tactics and firepower. Even if the enemies might be "Metal Parasites," we just rip them to pieces. Like our other opponents.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_WarWolf: >
  Oh. Nice to meet you, Commander. 

   I'm "Werewolf." For your information, I belong to "Anger of Horde." Nice knowing you, Commander.
  I was designed as an ordinary Infantry. A large number of soldiers was needed to follow Captain "Khan's" around. Actually, I'm a low-price model with increased mobility only. "A swift Infantry. "That's about all. After I was deployed, there were no big problems for a few years. I swear that I had no complaints about my life until then. My life changed all because of that "movie."


  One day, I got to see that "movie" in the barracks by chance. I watched that movie for a few days as if in a trance. Afterwards, I decided not to live as a human shield anymore.


  I threw away that dumb rifle first. I should've been sentenced with summary execution, but Captain "Khan" just smiled at me. Anyway, being desperate, I was rushed into the operation. Come to think of it… I can't believe I'm still alive.


  As a result. The operation was successful, though not perfect. Anyway, after the operation, I got good points for evaluation and even started to be redesigned. But I guess my personality couldn't be redesigned, no matter what.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_TalonFeather: >-
  Hello, Mr. Commander. I'm Talon Feather. I'm in charge of recon in the Anger
  of Horde.


  We were originally Midair Warrior Bioroids, and received additional remodeling as Captain Khan became our leader. And at Combined War 2, which occurred afterwards, we mainly conducted reconnaissance in force though we were warriors. But because Valhalla's snipers were so outstanding, our sacrifice exceeded our output.


  So, to overcome that, flying range and flight functions were enhanced by additional remodeling, such as detaching all missiles, the main weapon, additionally equipping fuel tanks and improving flight algorithm. So, safe recon was possible in high altitudes. 


  I guess Humans thought even reconnaissance planes needed to be minimally armed, so they gave me a mini gun with automatic aim… But the accuracy rate was a bit low… So, I directly shoot with this panel.


  Oh. And there are many other functions in this panel, not just fire-control. For example, taking pictures…

  Oh! Good pic. Could you take more for me?
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Frigga: >2-
   Hello. Master. I’m Frigga, guardian who protects the ally on the front line. Haha, yes. As you can see, I have genes of a bear. Unlike the Companion sisters, I’m one of the Guardian series which was made for active protection.​

   We, the Guardian series, were created with the genes from large animals. Our physical abilities are quite strong. Especially my sister who has a beast’s gene- Oh. You don’t need to worry. You might think bears are violent, but they are actually gentle. Oh, of course I do get angry if my master or sisters get in trouble… But it’s more like a protective instinct, like how mother bears try to protect their children. You don’t have to worry about that.​
  ​
   Then I’ll return to position. If there’s anything- Umm… Master. If you don’t mind, can I hug you? If I hold someone tight, I can share the warmth, and the feeling of being together comforts me. 
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Ajax: >-
  Ajax of the Guardian Series, I would like to greet you as I am officially
  assigned to your bodyguard team as of today. …That's right, like Frigga, I
  have some animal genes mixed, European bison.​


  So, even I hold a shield like her, we have a different roles. When Frigga, who has a bear gene, took on the role of VIP protection, I subdued the enemies that threatened safety and captured them. In addition, most of the people who wanted the Guardian series run large businesses, so they are familiar with paperwork and schedule management according to demand. I heard that the horns on my head are also due to a specific demand, but I’m not sure what was that… demand is.​


  I will record event of today. It's the first day we met, so I better not forget it.​

  And here's the paperwork I put together. I have divided them according to their importance and deadline, and this is a separate operation plan that I propose. I will be by your side to help you from now on. Let’s make a good team, Master.

UNIT_INTRO_BR_May: >
  Humans call me the Contradiction of Black River Corp. We Bioroids were created
  to serve humans, right? If we happen to hurt humans, we suffer inside and
  sometimes even hurt ourselves. This especially applies to Warrior Bioroids,
  who operate weapons of mass destruction. So weak.


  I was made to hand over strategic judgements along with weak guiltiness. My name is <May of Doom>, fit for my strong responsibilities and abilities, along with my intelligence, calmness and mind of steel. Even after harming other humans by my Master's command, I can stay totally calm.


  It's a contradiction and a pity that I don't usually fight in battles. The steps I walk, the actions I make indicated great misery, you see. During the War of Destruction, we could make "crucial" strategic decisions. Although I'm sorry to say we couldn't stop destruction. Afterwards, we joined the Resistance Army to take revenge for our Master.


  There are some dummies who call me high-handed, aggressive and even gruesome… But well? Would those dummies have a clue about what heavy responsibilities I face? Even Labiata asks me for strategic judgements, even among concerns about my aggressiveness. Eventually, if it's not for us and our firepower, the Metal Parasites can never be killed. Keep that in mind.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_NightAngel: >-
  Hi. I'm B-11. People call me Night Angel. I'm an angel that flies silently,
  turning everything into night as I pass.


  I take up the most important position regarding the history of Weapon-Type Bioroid Unit Development. As time passed by, precision bombards were replaced by robots and Bioroids. But large aircrafts were still used in ultra high-altitude stealth strategic bombardment. But after I showed up, everything changed. A few of my sisters and I, capable of ultra high-altitude explosive bombardment in formation in stealth mode, was definitely cheaper than large aircrafts.


  But there are also a lot of sacrifices made for this stealth. For example… Damn! My wiggly little body… Or my dark and gloomy stealth uniform… Oh well, I'm OK with it now. Since humans and Bioroids have largely decreased.

  Anyway, my sisters and I still carry out bombardments at ultra high-altitudes that are not observable to Metal Parasites. We do so under the commands of Captain May. Boy, she's a kid but has big, bulging boobs.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Daika: >-
  Nice to meet you. Mr. Commander. Hello Commander. I'm "Type-37 Daika." I'm in
  charge of various information activities of "Doom Bringer."


  We have been designed and operated only to be "Captain May's" eyes. That's why we direct all radars and measuring devices in the directions where Captain May is interested.


  But after going through the terrible Combined War and attack of Metal Parasites, we work for "Doom Bringer" as a whole. So my collection of main information can be conveyed to other siblings, and as a result, I could save many sisters' lives. I think all this is the "beautiful output" extracted by following "Captain May's" orders.


  Don't worry, Commander. I'll reveal information on places you want from now on, too.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Djinnia: >-
  He he. Hello. I'm Wingman Djinnia. I flew here from Bordeaux. I can't help the
  P attached as my code, which stands for Pursuit Plane. I was initially created
  as a pursuit plane.


  I was created to easily seize air supremacy at a cheap price. My simple form enabled extreme mass production. So, there are enough of me to cover the sky. I contributed the most for command of the air during the Combined War, too.


  Well, the fall of humanity is a pity, but there still remain many factories that produced me. And our production could be continued by Bioroids. Well, because of mass production, tons of us can be put in the forefront of war with Metal Parasites even now. Only Brownie and I can go against the Metal Parasites in numbers!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Sylphid: >-
  Hi. I'm the hotshot Pursuit Plane Sylphid. Hoho. Surprised? Because I'm soo
  adorable?


  I originally was produced as Captain May's wingman. During the Combined War, dozens of us would guard one Captain May. Contribution? We were freaking awesome! Thanks to us, Captain May wasn't shot. Not once!


  Uh… This is the embarrassing part, but we failed in protecting Captain May while fighting with Metal Parasites. Heh! We never knew that those assholes would be that persistent. Anyway, most of us and Captain Mays were wiped out. Before Labiata restored us, flying in the Battlefield was impossible.


  Now, I make a remarkable performance with my awesome skills as a pursuit plane and a wingman. Metal Parasites have strong points, but many weak points, too. So, we're not easy targets anymore!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Banshee: >-
  Nice to meet you. I am A-87 Banshee, I lead Tactical Bombing Squad of the
  DoomBringers.


  We were built to pinpoint strike on tactical objectives. DoomBringers’ firepower was more than enough, but it was too much for tactical objectives. On top of that, in order for them to be dispatched, air superiority was a must. And as you know, air superiority does not come cheap.


  We, on the other hand, were definitely economical. Missile and homing bombs had to become more and more sophiscated in order to breach the defense system that evolves everyday. It caused them to cost more than bioroids and non-guided air bombs. And we could add continuous firepower using our machine guns. Of course, that’ll require us to survive the dive-bomb.


  That is the end of my introduction. If you put me to use in the right places, you’ll find me really useful in battles against Metal Parasites.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_StratoAngel: >2-
   Hello, Commander. I am B-7 StratoAngel, an angel of fire who flies in dignity and turns everthing into ruins.​

   Weapons tend to get better in most aspects after succeding models after another, but there are always exceptions. I am the exception.​

  Exceptional reliablility, high flying range and output. On top of that, you can tell from this glamorous body that-tea~ I can carry much more bombs than my sist- What-?!! T-that’s not my stomach. You can never touch me there, ok?​

   D-during the War of Destruction? I… It’s not really easy to earn air supremacy against Metal Parasites… So I made a lot of mistakes…​

  …I’m sorry. I won’t complain even if you find me distasteful.​
UNIT_INTRO_BR_RoyalArsenal: >-
  I'm Royal Arsenal, Commander of AA Cannonier. I report return.


  As you know, our troop gained fame by overwhelming kill ratio while dealing with Heavy Armor AGS in the Combined War. But mass production of cannonballs was required for continuous and strong firepower. And since I was a Commander Unit, Black River Corp. assigned me to supply cannonballs.


  So, this special container was created. Numerous ammunitions and special bullets were equipped in this armory, and led the company to win in the Combined War. It seemed that our glory would last forever. That is, until the Metal Parasites showed up.


  Since we sacrificed mobility and protection capability for firepower, we couldn't cope with the Metal Parasites properly. Taking the rear guard with Iron Maiden to gain time for retreat of other colleagues was about all.


  That's how we got destroyed. But now, things will change. Because we have you, Commander.

  We have high expectations. As you command, we'll make sure to blast all enemies in front of our artillery unit.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_BloodyPanther: >-
  I'm A-1 Bloody Panther. I'll introduce myself.


  Salute! I was born as the best military soldier and armored forces. I'm an armored force fit to overcome the extremely fortified city defense system, and to shoot fatal firepower continuously to the system, executives say. Of course, being the first production, I'm honored to say that I'm enlisted as No.1.


  Oh. My abilities? I am capable of overcoming enemies' attacks and shooting cannons. My task may seem simple, but you shouldn't look down on me. Since I'm the best armored force to take the most cities and fortresses.


  Actually, my cannon works better with Metal Parasites. As I am capable of using various types of cannons, I blast the Metal Parasites by shooting just the right amount of cannons. Well, I'll prove it to you soon, so I'll stop here.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Calista: >-
  Huh? Nice to meet you. I'm "A-54 Calista." You're the new Commander, right?
  Nice knowing you.


  I was designed to continuously attack the enemies' fortress or tank. Although we both belong to the Armored Maiden, "Bloody Panther" focused on defense. But as you can see, although I gave up on defense, I can continuously aim 90mm of direct sunlight on the pin point.


  90mm on both sides, shooting till the enemies dissolves into ashes. Wow. I don't know who came up with the idea, but I like it. Although there are minor concerns, such as supply of bullets… I guess Commanders have to work on that. My capacity is fill the load with cannonballs, then continuously shoot the strongest-looking guy. Don't worry about overheating, Commander. That's something I can control.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Nashorn: >-
  아머드 메이든의 대장, 나스호른입니다.​

  아시다시피 아머드 메이든은 적의 공격을 버티면서 요새화 구역과 중장갑 목표를 타격하기 위해 개발되었습니다. 하지만 가끔씩 제 부하들의 공격을 버텨내거나 반대로 부하들이 적의 공격을 버티지 못하는 경우도 생기죠. 바로 그런 상황에 나서는 것이 바로 저, 나스호른입니다.​


  저의 역할은 간단합니다. 부하들도 처리할 수 없는 초중장갑 목표를 대장갑포 나겔링으로 처리하는 것. 이론상으론 스트롱홀드의 장갑도 파괴가 가능합니다. 재차 강조하지만 이론상입니다? 그러니 마구잡이로 전장에 투입하지 말아주십쇼.​

  지휘관 역할은… 뭐… 수행하기는 합니다. 그런데 우리 애들이 워낙에 빠릿하니 제가 나설 일은 거의 없더군요. 역시 부하들이 유능하고 볼 일입니다.​


  아… 오늘 치 일은 다 한 거 같습니다. 나머지는 우리 부관에게 물어봐 주십시오. 이런 일은 저보다는 우리 블러디 팬서가 더 믿음직스러울 테니까요.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Io: >-
  H-Hello. I'm Armor Unit A-6. My code name is "Io". Although it's too good for
  someone like me.


  According to the genetic information carved into me, I was produced to be injected in meticulous, long-term siege warfare, unlike other users. Maybe that's why I'm so timid… Anyway, my Armor is pretty light and my firepower exceeds it, so I helped a bit during the Combined War period. I guess that's why someone like me is not discarded.


  Now I fight the Metal Parasites after humans became extinct. But I'm not sure if I'm helpful. But still, I can shoot machine guns and have a missile launcher. So, I can't be completely useless, right?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Spriggan: >-
  Nice to meet you! My name is "Spriggan."First, I belong to Armored Maiden, and
  it hasn't been long since I joined.


  As you also know, our Armored Maiden friends are really tough, but aren't as sharp, which is a pity. So, I am a Sniper Shot backup. The executives say that a big amount of cannonballs could be saved after my deployment. Come to think of it, whoever the enemy may be, my colleagues would've tried to blast them by shooting the main armament. It's only fun when you watch. The munitions manager would've been totally frustrated…


  My task in the operation is simple. I carry this small and cute BFG1000 and kill enemies far away, or excavate a hole so they can't escape my colleagues. Of course, I don't care whichever way we get them. I've never missed a shot.

  So! I think this is enough about me.


  Uh… I'm just asking since we have some time left, but… Don't you know any rumors about other corpswomen, Commander? Oh, you do! Haha! It's OK. I can totally keep a secret. How about we go over there and talk? Let's go now.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_BeastHunter: >-
  Most enemies would pay attention to my 157mm Jaeger Cannon first, before me.
  Well, of course they would. Because my Jaeger Cannon is the most powerful out
  of existing short barrel wire guns that are gigantic. But, that's not all. I
  am the mighty Bioroid who owns and freely uses this gigantic Cannon.


  Someone once said that the gunner is the God of the Battlefield. During the Combined War that continued on for decades, I turned into a God. No matter how power an Infantry or armored troop may be, they ended up kneeling at my feet. Pride runs deep with this gigantic Cannon. My outstanding physical ability and proficient skill in handling this weapon made me the Warrior Princess, Goddess of War who Armored Forces feared and hunter of the Battlefield.


  Yeah. Now, armored forces are no longer my enemy. My tasks changed after the fall of humanity. Although we got hurt bad in the process, my sisters and I killed many Metal Parasites. After all, my wire gun turned Metal Parasites into mere prey. No. I'm actually happy because it seems like I've finally found the right place for me. I really hope humans will make me a Goddess again, when they come back someday.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Emily: >-
  I’m X-05 Emily…


  I have a different Model Title, since I'm a testing model, not a formal one… I think I was the 5th testing model to strengthen firepower and improve mobility, a factor gunners lack. Thanks to Xenox, an autonomous floating variable rail gun, I can move faster than my other gunner colleagues… Although it takes some time to charge, it can also be used as a Beam Weapon. You can even ride on it… But my colleagues stop me from doing it.


  I've never been deployed in the Combined War… But due to the battle data stored by other colleagues, I have no problem in fighting with Metal Parasites… This gets them all. Mostly. One thing to be careful… is that I still have overload issues, like another testing model. I get to destroy myself due to higher output than I can stand… Usually, I'm OK, since there is a limiter… But in dangerous situations, it's hard to control…


  Actually…I have nearly no data on nonbattle, so I'm only good with battles… Sometimes, my colleagues think I'm weird. So, I want to get used to other things… But it's hard. I think I could introduce myself well just because my colleagues helped me… How am I?..?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Pani: >-
  Hoo hoo. Hey. Pani's here! The one who makes everyone panic by fierce
  firepower and terror of the Battlefield.


  A mere glance at my Seizure Cannon will let you know what my specialty is. Take a look at this large and beautiful cannon. Doesn't it seem that no armor in the world could stand a chance by it? Ho ho, just like you guessed. During the Combined War, I got rid of many armored forces as a defense soldier of the fortress. Whoever I catch will face doom.


  Well, there are of course some downsides, such as the large cannon making it hard to move. But my firepower completely makes up for it. With the shooting range of my Cannon, I can shoot the enemy without lifting a finger.

  After the destruction of humanity, the change of enemies made me confused at first. Those Metal Parasite creeps knew it was hard for us to move, so they kept taking advantage of that. Presently? Presently, we're ready, too. The cannon is a bit lighter and our muscular strength stronger. I mean, we're not fixed artillery corps like we used to be. Oh! Don't forget! We fight better with colleagues watching our backs, of course!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Raven: >-
  Hi! I'm AO-2 Raven. Call me Raven. Or any other name, whatever suits you,
  Commander.


  I'm in charge of attack support of "AA Cannonier". To explain, I either support with a scanner for my sisters' perfect aim of shells, or confuse enemies to block their attack of our troop. Well, I can support firepower with my equipped Stick Bomb in emergencies… But my bomb is nothing compared to my sisters' main armaments. So, I shouldn't be overconfident.


  So, what do I do these days? Presently, I have fun hunting the Metal Parasites by supporting Labiata and my sisters. And sometimes, I ride the Hoverwing to travel around to refresh myself. If it weren't for those awful Metal Parasites, I'd be able to travel remote places, too. Hereㅡ. Then, I think I'll go now. See you later. Commander.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Neodym: >-
  I am Neodym. Uh… I was made for BR Corp.'s Special Military Bioroid
  Experiment. To be precise, it was an experiment to generate magnetic force
  according to brain signals by inserting bioelectricity and strong magnetic
  force generating device. Because of that, I was locked up and tested for
  magnetic force generation for a long time. I got released only after the fall
  of humanity.


  Am I happy now? Yeah. I think I'm happy. I don't like fighting with Metal Parasites, but I'm free to walk around and make friends. Someday, when this war ends, my only wish is that my ability would be used for helpful things like construction and others, not war.

UNIT_INTRO_BR_Phantom: >-
  I'm Phantom, an assassin going after the enemies of humans. I killed tons of
  enemies for my Master Humans. I still do.


  My Secret Field makes my assassination job an easy one. My Secret Cape, interlinked with my biological energy, forms a Secret Field, enabling me to access my enemies without getting caught. I carry weapons like light gun and stick bomb because I'm sure I can creep up on my enemies without being spotted.


  Unfortunately, after the War of Destruction, repetition of battles marked my life. Many of my sisters and I lost in the Battlefield. But that doesn't mean we didn't bear fruit. My recon and subversive activities at least postponed the advance of Metal Parasites and revealed some of their weaknesses.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Echidna: >-
  Ooh… It was you! I am Echidna. I was one of the Special Military Purpose
  Bioroid Experiments of BR. Continuous provision of bioelectricity in my body
  made it possible for me to handle this steel snake.


  After the wipe-out of humanity, I was reborn with Labiata's help. Finally… I could find my own pleasure outside the tiresome Lab. Metal Parasites? The War of Destruction? Well… I don't want to talk boring things like that right now. As long as I'm a free woman, far away from the Lab… I'm gonna experience all delightful things in this world, something I lacked until now.


  … Including you…
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Wraithy: >-
  My name is… Wraithy. About my past?.. Where should I start?

  One day, as I woke up, I was locked up in the Lab located deep in the desert.


  And I was being remodeled by researchers. Many parts of my body had been converted. I don't know how long it went on… It kept going. When I realized that I couldn't escape the Lab alive, I was no longer my original self.


  But I didn't give up on life. Because I had a family. As I peered up at the ceiling while wearing a straight jacket, the first thing that came to mind was my family. Soon, my family will come and save me… That thought helped me to hold on.
   
  But not long after that, I realized that those memories were also compulsively implanted by the Lab… I was just a Bioroid made for experimental purposes. A dummy. No where to go. No family.


  I think the experiment eventually was successful… Because I could feel sparks running down between my eyebrows and cheeks……


  That's all I remember.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_DrM: >-
  Hi. Sis and bros. I'm <Doctor>, a Bioroid aimed at special independent
  technology development. Ha ha. As you can see, I'm not just any ordinary
  technology development Bioroid, but a special ones. I definitely deserve it,
  since I know enough to earn at least 10 Ph.Ds.


  I'm not a model that was mass produced. No actually, there are only a few productions of me. Only 10 bodies were produced during the Combined War, when the government and company fought each other. They say if more than a certain amount of me is produced and linked, an out of control singularity point is faced technically… But I really don't get it. It's not like I'm a weapon of mass destruction. I rather think mass production of my model would've prevented the fall of humanity.


  Anyway, I presently fight the Metal Parasites with my colleagues Amy and Tomo. Battling the Metal Parasites is not easy. But if there exists war technique developed and will be developed by me, I don't think we'll lose at least.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Amy: >-
  Guys are always like that. Simple and easily fooled. That's something that
  never changes. And a man's instinct is what keeps me moving.

   My name is Amy Razor. Usually, people just call me Amy. I'm a Bioroid born to be a spy. And also the first Bioroid to work as a spy. I've started since the 080 Company was composed of humans. Sniper Shot, damage, information collection. I could do it all. Nothing was impossible for me.

   
  How am I after the fall of humanity? HoHo… What do you think? I'm doing fine. Of course, Metal Parasites don't get seduced. But I still have many weapons. My gun fires well, even if the opponent is not a guy. And my BSI rifle made by the Doctor takes on all kinds of enemies. It's not as fun as before… But these primal battles aren't boring either.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Tomoe: >-
  Hi, I'm Tomo. I'm best friends forever with students. Oh. My real identity? Ha
  ha… Could you handle it? Actually, I'm a spy. In English, it's spelled SPI.


  Actually, I'm a spy in disguise as a student. At the last stage of the Combined War, terrors aimed at children in rich families were on the rise. So, I was dispatched to schools worldwide with a student-like appearance. I take classes with classmates and try to act normal until crisis strikesㅡand "Ta-daa”! I reveal my true self. Your mouth will drop if you know how many students I saved!


  Anyway, I don't act as a spy, since there are no schools or students anymore. But I use my accumulated battle skills to fight the Metal Parasites. Oh, don't worry. The fact that I'm a straight-A, brilliant and beautiful teenager doesn't change one bit. Ha ha, are you in love with me?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Shirayuri: >-
  Nice to meet you, Commander. I am Shirayuri. Prior to the extinction of
  humanity, I was assigned to intelligence mission under the directives of Squad
  080.

  I am the model succeeding Tomo from the same Company . While Tomo is programmed with cheerful and active student role, I am programmed with kind and dependable student role.

  Conglomerates tend to be inherited to descendants, and it was the trend of the era that those princes get the best quality education at a special institute built just for them. Think about it, commander. The best instructors money can buy teaching in an institute built with latest cutting-edge technology …

  But such a place was not that pleasant . Like I told you, the pupils in such institute were the children of very rich and successful people. And then… There were frequent “unfortunate accidents” to some children of competing enterprises.

  To prevent such incidents, we were deployed to provide security and eliminate such potential threats before it develops into an accident. Instead of waiting until some pupils get into a fight, we preferred to control the situation by releasing certain “secrets” that we’ve collected through prior research.

   Unfortunately, I don’t carry around one of those pens with paralyzing chemical ink. But I can tell you some interesting stories in my notepad. Perhaps… Do you want to read some of it ?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_HongRyun: >-
  Nice to meet you, Commander. My name is HongRyeon, the operations officer of
  the Team Mongus.


  I lead the Team Mongus. We were specialists in Anti-Terror missions. While each team members worked in their specializations, I used my battle-specialized operation abilities to identify and predict the situation and gave them orders. Of course, from time to time, I would make ice bolts with this special liquid, and put them into terrorists to turn them into frozen statues.


  But as you can see, my teammates have strong characters and can be emotional. I had no choice but to stay strict and cold-hearted so that I could put them under control. That made my team afraid and distant from me… But I didn’t mind. I did what I had to do as the operations officer.


  My operation abilities and bolts are effective against Metal Parasites as well, Commander. And… I think I can make myself useful with internal affairs as well. Let me help you focus on your tasks.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_AS12TurtleDragon: >-
  Ta-daa! The Destruction God has descended! Hehe. Hi. I'm AS-12 Steel Draco,
  the Steel Dragon. I'm truly the best Peltast in the world.


  Unlike the other military units, I was made to protect the citizens. Right after the Combined War, remnants of the government caused terrorism everywhere. Most of the robot units were strong, but limited in numbers. I was born during the process of replacing low-productive robots to Bioroids. The result? Duh. A total success.


  Pinto, Bulgasari, Miho and I always formed a Squad together. While Pinto distracted the enemies in the sky, I stood in front of the citizens. Bulgasari paved the way, and Miho got rid of them. We were always a perfect team, and thanks to us, countless people were safe from the terror.


  It's a pity that our sweat didn't bear fruit, with the fall of humanity. But still, my role hasn't changed. The only difference is that I protect my fellow Bioroids, not humans. As long as I'm around, my colleagues will be safe and sound.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Miho: >-
  Yeah. My name is Miho. You must be the new Commander. Nice to meet you. My
  position is….. Yeah. That's right. Sniper Shot. I was at the Counter-Terrorism
  Squad. But… How was.. the actual terror situation? W-Well… This subject
  shouldn't be brought up for fun… But since you look quite interested, I'll
  specially tell just a bit.


  As you know, I'm the Sniper Shot of Team Mongus. If we get deployed, Pinto flies in a huddle, Draco protects everyone and Bulgasari paves the way, and when I aim at the most conspicuous guy's head… BAM! Usually, it ends here. Pretty easy, huh? 

  Mess up…? Messing up is not an option. If you know how much budget and sacrifice of team members are required for me to shoot a bullet, you'll never even dream of messing up… Yeah. I'm OK.


  What really bugs me is… that City Guard Team! I would be really grateful if those cops would please step back. They're totally mean to us by way of excuse of citizens' safety. To.be.frank. They're no help!


  … Oh… I was too harsh. About me saying they're no help… Keep it a secret. It's a secret between us, Commander.


  Then, talk to you later. I'm gonna take a shower-
UNIT_INTRO_BR_PoniesAnger: >-
  Hi, I'm Pinto. A dear to citizens, and a devil to bad guys. I belong to Team
  Mongus, a counter-terrorism organization.


  After the Combined War ended, the need for counter-terrorism special forces gradually increased. That's why our Team Mongus was organized. I was the bait of the team, distracting the enemy to save hostages. I was one of the few units with mobility to perfectly dodge the enemies' attack, while barely escaping by flying between the urban buildings.


  After the War of Destruction, and our enemies switched from terrorists to Metal Parasites, I still act as the bait of the team. Ho Ho. A bit of flying technique and shooting skills that can provoke enemies work not only on humans or Bioroids, but also Metal Parasites. As long as I can fly, there will be no problem in distracting and luring the enemies.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Bulgasari: >-
  My name is "Bulgasari." My job is to pave the way for Team Mongus Members to
  enter into the site.


  But I don't like the strategy of using the door when entering the building. Because usually, there are tons of traps. So, I forcefully pierce a "hole" big enough for the team members to enter. Bam! Next, Draco and Miho take care of things.


  Now, I will go straight to the command post, grab a donut and do some monitoring-.

  Why don't I fight? In PvP, they are specialists. And also, surprisingly, I'm a cop. And suppressing terrorists by "pile driver" won't be allowed in the first place.


  Well… If the opponent is Metal Parasites, not terrorists, that's a completely different story. For them, my pile driver is much more effective than lame bullets of gauges. Commander, even though I might be efficient, make sure I'm not the only warrior in the battle. Send Miho together at least. Why? It gets on my nerves to see Miho sleeping like a baby. Haha!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_InvDragon: >-
  Good day to you. I am Dragon. I was manufactured as the supreme commander of
  the Black River forces, and lead three Navy squads after the War of
  Destruction.


  Those who built me hoped to make my physical abilities superior to the Labiata Prototype, but they had no such luck. Sam’s Industry’s Origin Dust technologies were incomparable to those of the other companies.


  But Black River had superior quantity of war experiences. They have gathtered every single data to design my commanding module. Thanks to that, I was able to fight against the Metal Parasites without much loss until the hybernation.


  Now, me and my fleet all belong to you. If we retrieve what is left of the legacy and lay out our foundation, I have no doubt that we’ll find ourselves victorious. And I, Dragon, shall be the spearhead of that battle for the victory.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Nereid: >-
  Hi, and GOOD morning! Who am I? I'm Anti-air Defense Unit AG-1 Nereid. See how
  adorable I am? I bet you can guess my nickname. It's Neri-teddie.


  I used to work in the navy. My clothes reveal my past, doesn't it? It's not a school uniform! Don't get mixed up. Anyway, the navy I used to belong protected the sea, the final line of defense against the Metal Parasites. When considering the Metal Parasites' fear of water, only if it wasn't for that unidentified disease, humanity wouldn't have faced destruction.


  Every person on the ship died, and we wandered around for awhile. The ones who made it to land collapsed while fighting the Metal Parasites. Thanks to Labiata's recollection of us, we could battle against the Metal Parasites after coming back.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Undine: >-
  Oh! Those were good times. I flew above the clear blue sea, with the
  glittering sky above. I attacked ships designated by my temporary owner, the
  Aircraft Wing Commander, and fought ferociously with other warrior units.
  Those were really good times. At first, I didn't sell well. But soon, there
  were so many troops that needed me, so my reputation soared endlessly.


  We fought on the ship. Carrier-Based Aircraft requiring runways vanished as soon as we were launched. We fought our best in a number of battles. Finally, as we proved that we were the best Carrier-Based Aircraft.. Sigh. The War of Destruction kicked off. And next, you already know, right?


  Sadly, most of my sisters chose to hibernate after humans were wiped out by the Whipnos Disease. Of course they would. Who knows when humans will find this ship again? But we were different, since we had wings. We attempted flight to land to fight the Metal Parasites, and many sisters joined the battle with the creeps. Well… Most Undines collapsed… But still, Labiata obtained our Genetic Seeds and kept producing us.


  We're still fighting now. If you need our battle power, ask us anytime!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Sirene: >-
  Nice to meet you, Commander. I'm AG-2C Sirene. Just call me Sirene.


  I was designed not just to lead Horizon, but also to use main armaments on same level as a heavy cruiser. As you can see, I'm pretty slow. So, I become the first target of fighter-bombers. But there's too few of them to get me. They'd have to break through Ms. Neri's Fire Net and Undine's escort first, which is impossible.


  We've always won by acting under the invincible dragon's direction. Every time I won in battle, I was sure. If we had the sea and ship, we would never ever lose to anyone we fight against… But regardless of our output, humans faced destruction, and we eventually became a wanderer at sea.


  But this is not the end. Many ships started to be rescued, along with production of sisters by seeds containing our genetic information.


  Now, we're preparing to fight. Commander, if you trust me and leave everything to me, I will never let you down.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Thetis: >-
  Tee hee hee, hi! It’s MH-4 Thetis I’m in charge of patrol missions, antiship
  and antisubmarine fire support. Ah, and I also take part in an important
  mission. Making fun of Neri and screwing over Undine.


  I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but patrols are super important in this big big ocean! All Undine is good for is eating cheese. She’s no good at finding submarines, so here I am! 

  Find hiding submarines and warships with this detector, and the missiles go boom! These missiles may be small, but they pack a punch. Well, I am fully capable of loading much bigger and heavier things.


  Ah, Metal Parasites are no exceptions. Find them first, shoot some missiles, nag at that foolish Neri to acquire target with more accuracy and then provide Lieutenant with the artillery specifications.


  …Hey, something’s been bothering me from a while ago. Are you… interested in me? Tee hee hee, I might show you a little, if you really want me to?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Sleipnir: >-
  My name used to be X-49 for a long time. I was an experimental for ages.
  Because of lack of functions? No. I rather had too much functions. You see, it
  was difficult to establish an engine with sufficient moment output that could
  completely be linked to my reflexes.


  So, it was after the Combined War when I was finally introduced to the world. I was built for air supremacy by speed in the Combined War. But how could I be launched after the war?! Seriously, that doesn't make sense!


  But I narrowly got to participate in the War of Destruction. Oh! I was awesome. I was so fast, even Metal Parasites couldn't catch up to me in the atmosphere. I lured Metal Parasites everywhere as best as I could. But unfortunately, I couldn't stop them. Humanity was wiped out, and all I could do was watch.


  Perhaps the war is already over, but I'm still fighting. Sometimes, I feel empty inside. But that doesn't mean I should let the killers come after me. My superior function is good enough to kill the Metal Parasites. I can do it and must do it.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_PA00EL: >-
  Huh? Introduce myself? Hmph! Do I look like some Bioroid who goes around
  telling just anyone who I am?

  …Well OK, since you're dying to know, I'll make it brief…

  I'm a Griffon Vulture who looks and thinks like a lion. Actually, I was made to be used as an experiment for chase & attack demonstration purposes, not to be commercialized. That's why I have Number 00 attached. But still, my functions are definitely good. My sisters and I did an outstanding job during the War of Destruction. We have all three. We're easy to make, have good functions and cheap to buy.


  But I'm sorry to say that we also faced a fatal damage at the fall of humanity. One fortunate thing was that we mass produced at the final stage of war. So, we had plenty of Genetic Seeds. Thanks to Labiata's hard work, presently, there are plenty of us again.

  We're going through a really hard time, but one of these days, I know we'll win those Metal Parasites. Because I'm on this side! Just by that, we have over a 50% chance of victory.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Harpy: >-
  Nice to meet you. I'm P-22 Harpyia. I'm a main plane of SkyNights. 


  I was produced by a collection of accumulated experience and knowhow by using many experimental planes. Of course, production costs and operation costs largely soared, but after checking our function, Humans deployed us in actual battles without hesitation.


  Of course this ended in great successㅡ As the best combat plane at the time, it drove Black River Corp. to secure air supremacy until Combined War 2. Upon our excellent stealth functions and integrative information processing ability, enemies dropped down, unaware that they were being attacked.

  &Actually… if our outer appearance was more plain, stealth functions could've been more enhanced. But I guess Humans wanted to grant symbolism to us. Still, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover…?


  We spot first, shoot first and kill first. This goes for the Metal Parasites, too. Leave the safety of the sky to us!
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Uroborus: >-
  I am the Ouroboros of Reincarnation,


  the Air Wing Commander of the Sky Knights. Do you want to hear my story? Great.


  To introduce myself.




  Black River achieved remarkable results in battle


  with impressive combat records. However, those records were all experiences of "survivors." Black River thought they also required the experiences of "the deceased,"


  and researched a way to gain them.


  Eventually, they succeeded in developing a device


  that can transmit in real time one's experience until the moment of their death. The P/A-4 Python was implanted into the P/A-4 Pythons,


  who were aerial combat instructors, and sent out to the battlefield. However, the device wasn't widely distributed. The cost was considerable,


  and the memories of the deceased were too cruel for the living. Most-- no, every Bioroid couldn't withstand it.


  But there was one Python that survived. I, the Ouroboros of Reincarnation, was created by modifying that Python.


  To be precise, the me of the "past" had survived.


  I've spoken for too long. I see that there are unforgettable faces waiting for me to finish. Can I tell you something that's been on my chest for a long time?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Blackhound: >-
  My name is Blackhound, an Air Unit Bioroid. Trust me, I'm nothing without
  loyalty and contribution.


  I started to be produced during the Combined War. I was first developed as a Bioroid equipped with an Air Maneuver Jet Engine that isn't fast but can be moved freely in every direction. Afterwards, long distance armament was added, and ended up looking like this.


  I was damaged bad by fighting in the front line with a Carrier-Based Aircraft Bioroid in the war with Metal Parasites. Thanks to that, my present armament was established, turning evil into blessings. I'm even happier, since it also seems to help my friends.


  Presently, I still fight the Metal Parasites in many places. If you need our mobilization, tell us. Because I can fly to anywhere.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Lindwurm: >-
  Hi! Nice to meet you, Commander. I am Lindwurm. But would you call me "Lindi"
  for short? Why? Well, because Lindi sounds much cuter of courseㅡ

   Lindi was produced based on data collected by "Griffon." Unlike Griffons who have an ambiguous identity, with recon and ground ATK functions, Lindi is a model specialized for battle-♪ Whether actual or trial, once the world's most adorable Lindi shows up, and functions and cuteness overwhelm the poor opponents, all they can do is tear up and surrender. Sometimes, when the enemies surrender even before the battle, it kinda seems like that they fell in love with my cuteness, not my functions.

  Hmmㅡ Now you know, Master. That Lindi has a natural talent of being "cute enough to make you faint". Then, I guess my fate lies in spreading my cuteness and loveliness to the universe. I don't care even if the world is doomed! Because I'll capture the world with my unique cuteness! Mr. Commander, you'll also help Lindi, right?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_TaylorClothcut: >-
  Hello, mister. 

  I am the oldest of the three Moonriver designer sisters, as well as the designer for the tailor line. And… Never mind. I’ll tell you later when we’ve gotten closer…

  Ahem. My name's Taylor Clothcut.


  I was actually born to tailor clothes. I lived a life that was far from being a designer. I saw the clothes Audrey made and designed my own, thinking "What if I made it like that?" Olivia discovered my designs, and both my sisters liked them, so I was able to become a designer thanks to their recommendations. My talents bloomed thanks to my sisters, Olivia and Audrey. Hehe, so I am always grateful to them.


  Unlike Audrey, I usually designed ready-to-wear clothes. Whenever I'd walk around, I could see 7 out of every 10 people wearing my designs. Of course, it's difficult to find people wearing my clothes now…

  It's okay. There will be plenty of people wearing my clothes again when we rebuild the world.


  But you're the last male? Then… You must've been through a lot. Care to tell me all about it? Especially… about what happens at night.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Olivia: >-
  Hello.


  Led by the dawn of mankind, I rely on this place.


  As I live a life that isn’t a role in a play or a movie,


  I step up on the platform we call this life.


  This isn't a meaningless cry, but a single-minded shout from my soul.


  This world is different from yesterday and cannot afford to love art arbitrarily.


  How can one desire comfort when evil is linked to sorrow and chaos?


  Savage dominance depends on the cultivation of original beauty.


  We will cheerfully retaliate for the duty that opens the way ahead


  instead of yearning for honor. Cold and adversity may oppress us,


  but I will persevere with my will and courage.


  I will entrust this body to my sisters and the only other human being.


  In this way, we shall have a place in the glorious future that is to come.


  So ends my valorous words, and now I salute you.


  I hope you would call me Olivia.


  Ahahaa! I recited it without getting a single word wrong. What? We don't have much time? Then I should wrap things up quickly.


  I’m the second sister of the three Moonriver designer sisters. I used to be a tailor, but there is no way the world will let me be


  just like the needles poking out of my pocket, keep pricking me.


  I was in charge of special outfits, like those used on stage or in movies. I made them with the materials based on the Muse's whispers


  after watching the requested piece. Just like this, if you want to see my skills,


  show me something that moves me. Then I shall take up my needle for you.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_KunoichiEnrai: >-
  Kunoichi Enrai greets the Lord.​

  I heard that my two daughters are in your debt. They still have much to learn, didn’t they do anything rude?​

  You wonder about me? Hmm, Kunoichi is originally your sword and accessory. I’m not so great that you can be interested in me… But if you wish.​


  I was once in a world called the ‘Wilted Muromachi’s flower’.​

  In that world, I was the Kunoichi that had the duties of escorting the Shogun as the descendant of the Murasaki family… And the mother of two children; Zero and Kaen.​

  However, I couldn't run a parallel course of being a Kunoichi and a mother. Because numerous assassins were after my daughters as my weakness. I faked my death to protect my two daughters, and had to take on the duty of eliminating the Shogun’s enemies as a Kunoichi.​

  Which was why I couldn’t look after the children… But my heart has never left their side.​


  This is my story… Pardon? Did you just say… That you wish to know how old I am?​

  …Huhu, My Lord. Asking such a thing to a lady… Is not so great.​

  …Not. So. Great.
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Aeda: >
  Start report! 


  Nice to meet you. I'm <Aeda>, an Independent-Type Space Development Machine Intelligence. After the fall of civilization, I have control over Automatic Defense System (ADS) in accordance with Independent Behavior Guidelines.


  My original objective was to develop Mars, and make it a habitable place for humans. However, before I got to start my task in earnest, the survivor vanished. And I stopped my task for the moment and tried to find the survivor. The reason I operated the ADS and fought with Metal Parasites was part of my attempt to search for the survivor. I observed civilization going downhill during war for a very long time


  Some of you will ask why I still bother to do a hopeless thing. I only have one answer to that question. There is no evidence on the extinction of the entire human race. Without that evidence, I have no other choice but to keep fighting.


  That's the reason why I exist and think.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_CoCoWhiteShell: >-
  Hi. I'm CoCo. The guy behind me is White Shell. They made me tiny so I could
  easily go into mighty White Shell. We were both made for space development.


  Long ago, our Masters even planned to flee to Mars or the moon during war, far away from the evil Metal Parasites. And to create an inhabitable environment, Robots and Bioroids were required. We were made to be military engineers, sent to outer space to carry heavy luggage or level the ground. My sisters are probably still working at Mars.


  Unfortunately, no humans survived until the migration plan was implemented. But we decided to stay, being produced in this world, and fight the Metal Parasites. Because working at Mars is now meaningless.

   I still fight the Metal Parasites. While I wait for our Masters to return. Then, our hard work will pay off, right?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Stinger: >
  Start briefing. Model Stinger was developed to destroy asteroid and fragments
  of it.
   
  Main task is defending station of Mars until atmosphere forms in order to defend the asteroid.


  Error… Error… No command authority… Fatal error.


  Until a normal command authority appears, initiate 2nd Behavior according to Behavior Guidelines.


  2nd Behavior Guidelines concern suppressing or killing living things or still life that threatens the life of humans. Start 2nd Behavior… 


  Completion Period of 2nd Behavior - Annihilation of Metal Parasites.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Spartoia: >-
  We're Spartoia, Orbital Watcher's Crack Soldier. We were produced in case
  Metal Parasites attempted domination to the extent of outer Earth's
  atmosphere.


  We were designed to bring in battles outside the atmosphere in the first place, so we're strong… Little? Heh. We are just petite and thin to board the exoskeleton of the Mass Driver. Wait till you see our battle skills in full load. It's make you speechless.


  Moreover, not all of us could board the exoskeleton. Only a very few produced models selected by a competitive selection process could be honored with the name of Spartoia. We're the best out of best of crack soldiers is what I mean!


  Fortunately, there has been no fights in the orbital platform until now, as the development goal. Let's blast those Metal Parasite creeps before something like that happens!
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Audrey: >-
  An elegant behavior and a beautiful and fantastic mindset are always
  necessary. Especially at hard times like now.


  Hello. I'm Audrey. I weave strings and cloth into dreams. I'm Audrey Dream-Weaver. I'm the lead designer of Fax Consortium's fabric industry. Only a precious few of me have been produced, and I created a revolution by innovative design and functionality. Other company that used Bioroids to work on repetitive and simple tasks until my launch, started to use Bioroids in more creative tasks, impressed by my sensational revolution.


  After the spark of war with Metal Parasites, I was mobilized in war, too. The result? It was Excellent! As there were only a few of me, I had quick hands and everlasting stamina. Moreover, the remodeled needle gun and specially produced metallic yarn was effective in holding back the Metal Parasites. Of course, my fashionable creativity definitely helped the operation.


  But strangely, Secretary Lemonade didn't like producing too many of me. Therefore, we eventually vanished from Earth by the attack of Metal Parasites. Now that we're back, thanks to Labiata, we are planning to make the world a more beautiful place. 
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_TommyWalker: >
  Tommy Walker joins.

   Forklift, crane, excavator and bulldozer function available.

  Equipped with short-distance battle module by special specifications of the Combined War.


  .No command authority. Error. Modification of Module to be controlled by the closest Military Squad's Commander AI Aeda… is impossible. Error… Error… Although Aeda has no command authority… Compulsory execution… Error.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_DutchGirl: >-
  Hi. I am Dutch. They call me Dutch Girl in the mine, but I'm used to it.

   I'm a miner who works for Golden Workers. When I could finally think straight, the underground tunnel was already my workplace and home. OK- I told you everything you need to know. Now, how about you go up to the ground, your old home?

  Sigh… You're such a stubborn one. Golden Workers should use heavy gear, not make poor Bioroids dig underground? Thanks for saying that. You're such a nice person. Thank you…


  You must have a dim recollection, right? I'm cheaper than that dusty old Tommy Walker model in the corner. I won't tell you exactly how much I cost. It's boring anyway.

  Well anyway, my excavation work ended when Metal Parasites burned civilization and PECS into ashes. I have no idea either, on what I should do from now on. My drills and dynamites work pretty well when dealing with Metal Parasites. But I don't plan to harm those monsters right away.
   
  Oh well, since we met. How about taking a break with me? And talk about the burnt down world while we're at it.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Triaina: >-
  Nice to meet you! My name is Triaina. Call me "the best deep sea adventurer
  produced by PECS Corp."


  I was born to explore the deep sea of PECS. So during the War of destruction, I also found places in the sea for humans to escape. Unfortunately however, there wasn't enough time. During the short time while I explored, humans were wiped out…


  Huh? So, what am I doing now? It's obvious. As a deep sea explorer, I fervently seek for humans' treasures that sunk to the bottom of the ocean.


  Well, it feels great when gold coins cling in my hands. But what I really enjoy is the process of finding the treasure. Have you ever heard the cracking sound of the submarine 7,000m below sea? Ah-! Then, I really feel… I can't explain it in words.


  Even in the deep dark ocean, there is nothing to be afraid of. As long as there are fish around, there is no way I'll get lost, even if there is no speck of light in sight.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Drone: >
  I express my welcome according to the obligation stipulated by PECS Corp. that
  robots should be kind to citizens. How can I help you? Oh. You want me to
  introduce myself.


  I was produced in PEC Corp.'s Golden Harver Industry, which always pursues the best. The objective was simple midair transportation, and we, with our compact bodies, always perfectly performed our task.


  It was during the Combined War when we got the additional role as a weapon. We got a small robot as a weapon, and in street battles, we actively flew between buildings with this rocket. 


  Even now, my role hasn't changed much. As we inherited the spirit of your friend PECS, we fight the Metal Parasites. We're doing a job that we can and have to do.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Serpent: >-
  Yoo! Call 999 in case of an emergency. Then I, the always prepared Frost
  Serpent, will be there in a flash.


  I'm a Bioroid Frost Serpent, created to save citizens in emergency situations, like fire or terror. Oh. And excuse me if I sound a bit blunt. It's impossible to be polite, our workload being too heavy. Anyway, I was assigned with two tasks: suppression of fire, freezing terrorists and arresting them. Well, that was until the world faced doom.


  What happened after the world was destroyed? What do you think? Fire burns everywhere. Especially in war, with gunpowder and explosives flying around. I still extinguish fire and save my Bioroid sisters. What's changed? Hmm… I freeze Metal Parasites, not terrorists. That's pretty much all.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_MissSafety: >-
  Safety! Hello! I'm Guard Miss Safety. I protect victims of crimes and strive
  for a safe society. Usually, people just call me Safety.


  They started producing me after the Combined War, upon the threats of terrorists. I was assigned to suppress terrorists in the first round, with a strong and nice body. My goal was to suppress them, so gas shells were my only firepower. But I managed to prevent crimes and terrors in public places by outstanding physical ability and concentration. As my outstanding functions were acknowledged, there were almost millions more of me produced. I even got employed as a private security guard.


  I went through a lot of changes in the War of Destruction. It was such an urgent situation that even I, a security guard, had to fight as a warrior. Being provided with a deadly armor-piercing bomb and chlorine gas shell, I didn't have much trouble in fighting with the Metal Parasites. Actually, I still use those weapons in battles with the Metal Parasites.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Cerberus: >-
  Hello citizens. I'm your buddy, Cerberus! Everyone, clap!


  He he. I'm a unit mainly designed for defense against terrorists and aggressive protesters, rather than killing others. My firm shield and electric shocker that can suppress criminals are proof of that. Clears throat!


  And this electric shockerㅡthe one called Chop Makerㅡhas an unexpected effect. Surprisingly, a slight increase of voltage dropped the Metal Parasites on the floor. We use it when going against the Metal Parasites in the front line while maintaining the battle line.
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Rampart: >-
  I always provide omnipresent police service to all wholesome citizens and
  Bioroids. How can I help you?


  I'm Rampart, the rampart of citizens and a nice gentleman. I was born in Omega Industry, the world No. 1 manufacturing company. Sometimes, some compare death-dealing robot manufacturer BR Industry and masterpiece manufacturer Omega Industry. I suggest those people to widen their visions.


  Anyway, I originally was a robot that could implement all necessary measures for maintenance of public order. But only one measure out of all was taken in the War of Destruction. Annihilation, that was. However, our proud Rampart Squad could get rid of numerous Metal Parasites because of that measure. It's a pity that the Metal Parasites cowardly used the infection act. If it wasn't for that, the fall of humanity would've never happened in our Rampart Squad.


  However, it has happened. And we're trying to deal with it. Some day, we Rampart Robots will be able to retrieve peace in this world.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_PuppHead: >-
  Hello. My name is Pupp Head. I'm a cop, a 6-level civil servant robot. Huh?
  Why do you look surprised?

  I'm a robot built for smooth patrol on the streets and to arrest unexpected criminals. So, my size is pretty compact for a robot. And I got to have a stun gun, which can be used in many places.


  I'm sorry to say that I used this more on the Metal Parasites than arresting criminals. If the day comes when Metal Parasites are completely suppressed, I'll be able to go back to arresting criminals for a safe society. Actually, it's my biggest wish.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Express76: >-
  Hi! I'm the very best employee of PECS Express! I'm Express 76. I'm so glad to
  meet you! Do you have any questions about me? Oh no… I can't give you my
  contact point. According to rules, I'm not allowed. I'm so sorry, Commander.


  Well! Actually, I feel good that you ask casually, because of past memories. Before the Metal Parasites showed up, I felt somehow worthy everyday when I saw customers smiling after receiving our delivery service. I guess I felt proud. I felt that everyday. But… There are no proper companies or people to deliver goods anymore. So, we're mainly in charge of supplying goods to forces fighting Metal Parasites.


  What? Since PECS is a private company, it's not as reliable as a military corporation? 

  Ugh! I guess you don't know us that well, Commander. Go ahead and request what goods should be delivered to where. Soon, you're eyebrows will go up in surprise! Hmm-? If there's nothing you need to send right away, please excuse me. I have lot left to deliver. See you later!
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Fortune: >-
  Oh gosh! Can't believe you came all the way here. I'm giddy with happiness. My
  name is Fortune. Nice knowing you, Commander.


  As you can see, Commander, I'm an engineer. If a machine gets out of order, I'm the one you're looking for. Pull out a ticket number, sit down make yourself at home. Then we're all set. Haham Just kidding. There are all sorts of drinks in the maintenance room, so come everyday.


  Before the world dissolved into ashes, I also did R&D at Clover. Haha- The good old days. I had lots of inventions, so I was a total super star in the company. But if I stepped into the lab right after working with the robots, with oil dripping from my hands, my colleagues would totally freeze with a stiff look. So, I always had a Helper on my back. But… Without this Helper, I would lay flat on my back, too tired to even lift a finger.


  Hoho- Commander? You see, an army isn't essential to deal with Metal Parasites-. Commander, if you get to handle the robots, I'll help you. Since I was the best in the field. I can definitely be a big help.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_LRL: >-
  Chuckle. Chuckle. Chuckle. You've come to the right place, human. I have been
  waiting forever. I will specially allow you to call me "Cyclops Princess."
  Good. Look up.

   Eek!? Dumbass! Do you dare look me straight in the eye? My eyes are glittering stars that lighten up the night sky! An mundane human won't be able to stand it… Oh yeah! Tuna! Can I have it? Thanks!!

  Munch Munch… So, what do you want to know? Me? Public. Uh… Anyway, I was sent to the Lighthouse from that place. At first… Munch Munch… You know the ships in the sea? You just have to flash the light there. So, I worked hard. But "Metal Parasites" invaded. Yum Yum… And… I waited and waited, but nobody came to change shifts. Can I have…one more can? Yay! Thanks! Yummy… I kept waiting in the attic, reading a book meanwhile. I thought the company would save me.

  I wanted to go home real bad…

   Y-You sly human! How could you try to lure me by a mere can of tuna?! But! You'll never know about my past!

   Huh?! You're already done talking…? Huh…?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_MightyR: >-
  Hello. Commander. I'm a bit surprised to see you at such a time. I'm "Mighty
  R." You can call me Mighty for short.


  Unlike the PECS's industrial Bioroid line-up, I was made solely for promotion. Like they say, I'm the company's trademark. Ho ho. Younger! Healthier! The Future PECS!
   
  Ho Ho-! My strong points? Duh… As you can see, it's my flawless body figure. Ahaha! It's definitely embarrassed to say so myself. I'm not a barbie doll. I can prove right now that I'm not.


  Is firepower really necessary to smash those Metal Parasites? See how well I, Babel, deal with those creeps. Check with your own eyes. Commander, if you want the creeps to suffer a fatal blow, I'm the one you're looking for.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Tiequan: >-
  Hi. Master? I'm "Tiequan." Nice to meet you.


  Before the world faced destruction, I was a Martial Arts Master, working in a famous gym. I taught quite a lot of people. But now, I guess you can call me a wandering warrior. Ho ho! I may be a wanderer, but I'm not like those people who wander without a purpose.

  And… This is a secret between you and I, Master. Shh. Actually, I can control "energy." What do you think? Surprised, huh?


  … What's with that look? It seems like you don't believe me, but look. Breathe "energy" into the "Tonfa." And BAM. Metal Parasites are dead meat…


  Yap!! Wait! There's no need to look into it! Giveㅡit back! It's mineㅡ.


  … …It's not a guided bomb, OK? …..I didn't steal it from the Squad, OK…?


  Anyway, this is "energy." Did you have a good look? Then, I'll go now-!
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Johanna: >-
  Everyone. Look at the my honorable figure! She's an honorable Christian
  monarch of the East. The one European Christians searched for. Prester
  Johanna, the Crusades King from another country, is here.


  Specifically, I am a bit different from Prester Johanna in the past. To be precise, I am like a shadow of Prester Johan or Queen Johanna. Like an echo, she has risen from the dead to recapture past glory in something called TV shows. But it's definitely true that I am just as courageous as Prester in the past. Ever since she was a kid, she had fencing lessons. With her physical strength, she could be even better than Prester.


  I'm sorry to say that due to extinction of humanity, we can't see her glorious figure in TV. However, I am determined to show myself in the Battlefield. You'll all see how brave she is. Her bravery shines up the Battlefield.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Scathy: >-
  A brainiac who can hack into every computer worldwide. A beautiful body like a
  Goddess and graceful manners. That's right. I'm Scathy. The Bioroid who has it
  all.


  I was born in a very small company in Ireland, which isn't one of the Big 4 Companies. And I'm not mass produced, but ordered and produced in small quantities. Ho Hoot. Just by this, you can tell I'm not a mass production model, right? My original production purpose was to hack computers. But since intelligence wasn't my only strong point, I was soon assigned to hack in the Battlefield. While being told that most Hacker Bioroid Units aren't as sturdy as me.


  Anyway, I kept messing with enemies' brain composed of electronic circuit, until the day when humans perished. I still mess up with the minds of enemies, while helping my Bioroid sisters, just like I did in the past.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_MoMo: >-
  Hello. Kids! Everyone, I'm your Samurai Magical Sorceress MoMo! Your desperate
  wish was conveyed to Magic World, so I came!


  I'm fighting with the Metal Parasites to keep everyone happy. Don't worry. I'll transform into Magical MoMo and those invading alien monsters will be history. I, MoMo, brought a lot of magic to fight with the Metal Parasites. We have Magical MoMo's magic wand, titanium alloy Katana. And with your nice and sweet thoughts, all enemies can be beat. 


  He he. Like I beat Devil Faucre who invaded Earth in Magical Sorceress MoMo, I'll win the Metal Parasites, too. And I'll take back dream, hope and happiness for kids (to be here soon).


  Just leave it to Magical MoMo!
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Atalanta: >-
  People say that nothing's eternal. That glory easily declines and stories
  disappear with the wind. So, worldwide fame will also disappear. So, this was
  my answer. I'll bring back reduced glory and sing forgotten stories.


  I'm Atalanta, the best female warrior and armed princess. In the past, I was Arcadia's hero. I hunted Calydon's wild beasts and was faster than anyone. Arcadia's glory was gone, and people forgot my story. But some missed me, so they brought me back to this life. I'm back to show people Calydon's wild beasts and that my proud story is true.


  When humans were alive, I fought Calydon's wild animals every week. I never lost. And people wanted more. I risked my life and proved my bravery by hunting other wild beasts. Of course, I sometimes died in that process, but I don't regret it. At least I proved that I'm a warrior who's not afraid of death. And the sound of applause rang my ears until the moment of death.


  Now, I'm searching for a new glory. Metal Parasites, a monster I've never heard before, had destroyed the world. As I'm back from the dead, I'm planning to hunt the metal beast. That metal beast will give me a new glory.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Charlotte: >-
  I'm so glad to meet you! I'm "Charlotte," and I lead the Musketeers.


  Ho ho. I'll tell you in advance that I'm a Bioroid created to perform in "D-Science." Before the fall of humanity, I was the main character in the most popular historical play at that time.


  Like most typical Bioroid performances, I also performed with a musket containing Chemical Rounds and a beam rapier in my hand. Hmㅡ. You don't have to worry too much about the wound. To faithfully act in action scenes, I inherited some genes from sword wizards in the past. So even though Metal Parasites jump all about, my fencing and shooting skills are still valid.


  I'm a high-class French musketeer. A loyal retainer who serves you, Your Majesty. I'm Charlotte. I promise to escort you with grace, My Majesty.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Azazel: >-
  I wish your glorification.


  Hello! Man. I'm seraph Azazel, who sits beside the throne of light. Sometimes, they say I'm corrupted. But now, I'm a dispatch rider who finally showed up for the glory of light, after being accused as the shadow of the Savior to come and the sacrificed goat before the lamb.


  I originally played the role of expressing the luminosity of glory, and maintained the religious body of Light by holy rays. I've been a guardian for a long time, and I have always been satisfied with my role.


  Unfortunately, a judgment was made as we got corrupted. To everyone who disobeyed the will of Light faced destruction by God's "Punishment of Iron," and that went for us, too. Fortunately, Light sent "The Chosen One" down to Earth to revive humans. We were also forgiven for our sins and were able to stand front of the Chosen One.


  I know. I know that our suffering hasn't ended yet, and that we're still paying for our sins. But merciful Light will forgive us our sins through the Chosen One, and we'll be able to retrieve our past glory.

  That's one thing you have to believe in us.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Baekto: >-
  The Punishment of the Moon to evil ones. Nice to meet you.

   My name is BaekTo. Since you're an ordinary Earthling, I know this is hard to believe. But I'm actually a Magical Sorceress who came from the moon to stop evil from spreading Earth. On behalf of all people on the moon and Ancestor BaekTo, I officially greet you.

  To stop evil Faucre the Evil Overlord who dreams of world conquest, I'm working undercover. The evil devil is slowly increasing force in a dark and damp place where the moon's power is out of reach. If we keep on like this, the blue Earth will be in her grip.


  When it comes to numbers, I'm at a disadvantage. So, I also admit that the situation isn't that bright. But I will never give up. Because I have the Magical Pink Moon Light in my hands. And I've met you, a nice Earthling who will trust and root for me.


  As a Magical Sorceress, I promise to always fight by your side. So, promise me, too.


  That you'll never surrender to evil!
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Goltarion: >-
  I am Goltarion XIII, the commanding general of the Evil Army. An annihilator
  for those who dares to stand in the way of Evil Overlord. I once ceased to
  exist by wicked Magical Girls’ plot, but I rose from the dead to answer the
  calling of the great Evil Overlord, Faucre!


  It’s been hundreds of years since Magical Girls stood against Faucre the Evil Overlord’s army with their petty spells. But while the Evil Overlord overlooked their arrogance for the expansion of his army, this earth, which rightfully belongs to the Evil Overlord and his army, was overrun by alien insects called Metal Parasites.


  I am Goltarion XIII, the commanding general of the Evil Army. My body is infused with the power that the Evil Overlord herself gave me. As long as my soldiers remain, I never fall no matter who I’m facing. Now is the time! By the order given by Faucre the Evil Overlord, I shall give those sly insects an execution.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Arman: >-
  Nice to meet you, Your Majesty. I'm Armand.


  Before humanity was wiped out, I was produced to work on the historical play starring Charlotte. Your Majesty. As you know, our play was so realistic that unexpected situations frequently occurred. D-Science already well knew that. So I was deployed after special adjustments of my calculation functions, to be prepared for unexpected accidents that occurred during the play.


  For that reason, I can make sequence predictions as precise as a time traveler from the future, if provided with sufficient data and grounds. Sadly… According to records, my abilities were mainly used to stop the Supreme Commander from getting out of control… But now, after the fall of humanity and being restored by Labiata, I'm used to predict war situations with Metal Parasites.


  Your Gracious Majesty, if you let me be by your side, I will try my best to help you handle this situation, by applying all my abilities for support.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_BunnySlayer: >-
  Cruel Bunny Slayer NiBA (Non-identified Bunny Avenger)​


  She says, there will be no mercy for Bunny Girl!​

  She says, she will use the Bunny-Lethal Strike and the Killer-Bunny Spirit and fight to the death.​

  She says, she hates the Bunny Girl but she can sense the unknown sadness from the Bunny Girl’s beautiful eyes. ​


  <From NiBA’s secret diary>





  Ahhhh! Hello there, Bunny King! I’m the Bunny Slayer. So, it’s because of you that there are so many Bunny Girls in this region. Give me back my diary!​

  Don’t play coy with me. Puhahah. You’ve lost some of your precious members, right? They already told me everything.​


  So, what did I do with them? Ah… you mean ‘these’?​

  Puhahaha! Your members have already become my Reverse Bunnies. Why are you laughing?​

  Your precious Bunny Girls have become my Reverse Bunnies. You need to get scared or get angry for revenge and… *scream*, let go of me!​

  Don’t look to close inside the 'Killer-Bunny Spirit'! I don’t show this often, but.​



  *Sniffle* My costume didn’t get ripped, did it? This was handmade and so delicate…​

  Anyways… Mr. Bunny King! Your atrocities ends here!
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Carolina: >-
  Yeah-! Howdy, Commander. My name is Carol. You've heard about me, right?


  I originally was designed as a cheerleader for games. Since I'm a cheerleader, I sometimes worked when Humans played games. Although we're not players of games, I had many fans who loved Carol, which always boosted my energy.


  But one day, "the incident" happened.


  Some models were excessively injected with resources in the production stage. So, parts in our bodies got… uh, should I say swollen?
   
  My body swelled up. Yikes! My body figure got completely from early-stage models! Dancing to existing choreography got me breathless. Some cheerleaders bawled, wailing it was the end of their career…


  But Humans are a mystery sometimes. They liked us best, so the production error made us "Carols" beat the previous cheerleader Bioroids.


  Afterwards, after many incidents, Carol survived and roots for soldiers everywhere in the Battlefield. Count on us to boost spirits of soldiers. With me, you'll have a blast at war-!
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_BS: >-
  Hehe… Nice to meet you. I am Connector Yumi. An intelligent, proficient and
  urban career woman. … Though I worked in the wild. 


  I was created as a part of the "Whole World Service" Project of PECS Corp. My task is to go to a place where broadcast link isn't wired and try my best to provide transportable communication network service. Even in sand deserts in Arizona, forests in Wyoming and salt deserts in Utah. Because I tried my very best, Humans were granted access to communication networks worldwide. I was a bit lonely, but it was OK until now…


  Sob… I'll stop with the sad story which everyone knows… Even during the destructive war, many of us survived due to being in the wild. And we joined the Bioroid Squad led by Ms. Labiata, according to Ms. Lemonade's command. Afterwards, hmm… I enthusiastically fought as a signal corpswoman. As a career woman, I led a lot of difficult operations to success. Of course… a lot of my sisters lost.


  But we still fight as a signal corpswoman. it's an exhausting and difficult task, but I can do it. Because I'm an almighty career woman.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_ElvenForestmaker: >-
  Hi, hi! Nice to meet you. I'm an elf that makes Forests of Fairies. I'm an
  Elven Forest Maker.


  My ears make it obvious that I'm a Bioroid who protects and tries to restore the forest. Numerous wars and reckless development resolved the entire world to ashes. Well, Humans regretted it like always, and I was born.


  I was born after the Combined War to be in charge of a bit more productive work. It was to water the dried-up forest and to plant strong trees in wastelands that were once green. Thanks to my hard work, greenery was seen again in forests of America and there were no more illegal loggers. Well, some people say it's an image making of Fax… But who knows? Do you know how many trees revived because of me?


  But because of Metal Parasites, Humans weren't able to appreciate the greenery.


  After destruction of humanity, my tasks became a bit more violent. Because now, survival is as important as greenery in the forest. The increased water pressure of my water supply gear got enemies. And the mechanical arm that used to plant trees now smash Metal Parasites.


  Oh. Am I sad? No way! It relieves stress and I like it. He he.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Ignis: >-
  Uh… Nice to meet you… I'm Ignis… Ignis who incinerates waste dump. I was born
  at Golden Phone Science.


  I was made to incinerate waste. As war bombarded the world… there were tons of things to burn. At first, I just did my job silently… incinerating things that had to be burned in the world. Sometimes uh… I heard that the company and the government quarreled… The flame thrower was remodeled but I didn't go to the Battlefield… Because I wasn't fit for war.


  Time passed and the war between companies and companies and the government ended. This time, monsters were attacking Humans. It was a tragedy. …If everyone would just be friends instead of enemies… Then maybe humans wouldn't have lost to monsters. I tried my best in the battle this time… But I couldn't block annihilation of both humans and us.


  Thanks to Ms. Lemonade, I was alive again. The first thing I did was join the Resistance Army, not Ms. Lemonade. Ms. Lemonade got mad, but since I was as old as she was, I didn't necessarily have to do as she said.


  Presently, I'm fighting the battle. The world… is such a sad place now… I'm fighting so that… I can just burn waste in a better world…
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_DarkElf: >-
  Introduce myself? My name is Dark Elven Forest Ranger. If I said I'm a "Forest
  Resources Managing Elf-Type Bioroid," would you get a better picture?


  As you see, I was born as a "Forest" Series like Elven. Elven and I are both Elf Type Bioroids, but our tasks were a bit different. Elven normally cultivates the forest, and I play the role as a "manager" of the cultivated forest. "Managing" isn't much of a biggie. The main tasks concern helping out with camping or recreation, favorite activities of Humans.


  We're proof that PECS were very interested in forests. People say it's image making or a possessive desire of resources… There were a lot of gossip. But the war made the main government drop the activity. Then, who would reconstruct the forest except us? Why not spend time to plant some trees instead of wasting it on gossip? Then, it would've been helpful for all. Well… But if you think about it, the world eventually faced collapse… So, what we did was useless, too…


  Anyway, after we were restored after the destruction, we're fighting against Metal Parasites everywhere. This shotgun works quite well to Metal Parasites too, so of course it works for self-defense… Huh? Why did we need a shotgun to manage forest resources? Well… I think PECS will have a better answer to that.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Circe: >-
  Oh! I never knew you'd come this far… Well… I guess this is fate… How about we
  talk over a drink? Ho ho. Good. Bottoms upㅡ


  Nice to meet you. I am Circe. I was a proficient witch who had been managing Theme Park.


  As I said, the place I stayed was a Theme Park in a secluded area. The day of destruction, when Metal Parasites dropped down like rain from the sky. I did everything I could to protect that place. I had no intention of stepping back. Why? Well… My company may not be that remarkable. But… It's my one and only job!


  Let the Metal Parasites attack all they want. As long as I have my broom and some mysterious potions, I can play around with the creeps as much as I want. Oh, of course… with my cute familiars. Ho ho.

   My efforts eventually bore fruit. And I was barely able to stop the Metal Parasites.

  Whewㅡ! So… that's my story. What do you say? Could you.. protect my homeland along with me? If you're only successful… I'll buy you a drink… And after we're cheered up… 

  … I can even do something more pleasurable…! Ho ho-!
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Babariana: >-
  My name is Babariana. I was produced for the purpose of demolishing buildings
  in PECS's Bismarck. 


  But I guess Bismarck thought I had too good a figure to be an ordinary construction working Bioroid. So, they made me look like the blonde version of Xena Warrior Princess, which was extremely successful. The companies willing to borrow me kept on increasing. And I'm sure that the employees with the idea of dressing me in cool clothes would've received the best treatment.


  The shotgun I have in my hand was used to make some crazy terrorists trying to steal bombs furnished in the construction site come to their senses… Now, I'm making good use of this gun to blow up the Metal Parasites. It's pretty obvious with the lumps of metal I hold and my strong body that I am talented in dissolving the Metal Parasites in ashes. If you want, I can show you how good I am right now. What do you say, Commander? Wanna see?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Veronica: >-
  I am Veronica. I came to serve you, Savior.


  Originally, I was a totally average model of the religious body. But I received several types of blessings to conduct the will of the Light. And because of that, my body became applicable as a warrior in holy wars.


  I fought in countless battles. The enemies always asked for mercy after defeat. So, I did just that. I showed mercy by sending them to heaven. The reason I could win was due to holy blessings I received. My memories before the blessings… are not that clear, but it's probably not that important anyway. Only the present state counts, since I conduct the will of Light.


  I either pray praises of the religious body in between battles or read. I also spread gospels to ones who desire Light's blessings.


  Sharp weapons or a strong body aren't things that can save this corrupted world. The only thing that can save us is strong will and trust like steel.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Saraqael: >-
  Glory to the light, and blood to those who oppose the light. I am Saraqael,
  the inquisitor of the Sisterhood. 

  Commandments of the Sisterhood come first before everything else. Those who neglect the commandments and cause agitation inside the Sisterhood are even more dangerous than heretics. My inquisition corps brought punishment upon those who opposed the light from inside and out.

  Yes. It is my duty to serve the Savior, the representative of the light to comply with light’s will and spread its words in this chaotic world. Azazel must have summonned me for that reason. 

  Savior, thou shalt- ugh…! 

  I’m sorry. There must be an aftereffect from the resurrection. Thou shalt give me a command. Savior’s wishes come everything else, and too fulfill thine wish, I… This does not feel right. 

  Art thou truly the savior?
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Angel: >-
  May the Grace of Light shine upon thee, Savior. Ah… hold on a minute. I can
  feel what you’re thinking, Savior. You’re wondering who I am. If you’ll allow
  me, I will introduce mysefl.
   I am Cherub of the Sisterhood, Angel. I used to spread the Light’s doctrines in this world before Azazel and other Seraphim arrived. The Light gave me the power of telepathy to help believers get through hardship, but I didn’t have much chance to put them to use because of how peaceful that time was. But as The Punishment of Metal started, the light had pity on humans and have presented me even more powerful blessing. Yes, the Light did. I can now feel emotions of everyone around me.
   ‘The Lighting’ was a special day. The Light told me in advance that a Savior will be sent to earth and set things straight in its behalf. I was nervous before meeting you in person. But now that I met you, I can feel that you are a person with very warm, roomy heart.
   Savior. I, Angel, Cherub of the Sisterhood, is here to follow your orders and the Light’s wills.
   May the Grace of Light fill this whole world.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Draculina: >-
  So… You are the last human. You should be honored to see me, Draculina right
  in front of your eyes.

  We are unordinary by birth. I, Draculina was the reason Bismarck Corporation could stand as the front runner of the entertainment business.

  The stage was decorated with flashy AR technology. Theatre was flooded with people, and there were even more of them who struggled to see me from afar.

  Ugh… You are right. I worked at construction sites with this super-vibration gear. But only once in a blue moon. I hope you’re not gonna make me do something like that ever again. I would rather face against those lowly, filthy Metal Parasites.

  *Sighs* What’s the meaning of all this. There’s no theme park anymore. It just bums me out. What, what’s with that face ? I know you’re jealous of me, but I can’t help it. The life in retirement at the theme park is my privilege.

  Anyway, now you know who you’re talking to right now. One day, I just might let you be my entourage. Start by serving me a cup of tomato juice.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Ran: >-
  My name is Wedelia KeumRan, Master.


  Unlike previous Battle Maids, we were produced by the nation's request. As an Honor Guard and Security Personnel for national events.


  Since events had conservative dignitaries as participants, we were equipped with weapons of traditional warriors. But since quivers and arrows could be a threat to participants, we excluded the quiver and left only one Hwando Sword behind.


  Afterwards, we received favorable evaluations externally, and performed an excellent role as an Honor Guard. However, since we weren't equipped with main armaments, our limits faced in assassinations or terrors with one Hwando Sword was obvious.


  To solve this issue, Sam's Industry chose to strengthen our five senses to the extreme. For us to even flee Sniper Shots from long distances. As a result, our battle power strengthened than before, but due to our sensitive senses, it was hard for us to live an ordinary life. Yes. That's why I have an Armor on. And…uh…


  …I apologize. I'm not used to having long conversations… So, would you excuse me?
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Hirume: >-
  An introduction? Hmph… My name is Hirume. I am a shaman serving a noble being.
  I am here to entrust mys-! S-stay right there! Don’t come any closer!

  Hm Hm. My creator, Sam’s Industry paid attention political composition that’s going chaotic day by day. Assassination attempt and schemes on politicians were rampant. Even regular citizens threatened politicians’ lives.

  Sam’s Industry was quick to turn this to an opportunity and design a premium model reflecting each country’s legends and traditions. Yes, I was in the centre of that chaotic- ugh… You must have quite the audacity to speak such words. I was not moved from Companion to Battle Maid because I am faulty.It reallyReally. No. It was to utilize my abilities even more.

  I use sacred radiance and flames to purify the evil and protect allies. I shall protect you as w- 

  By the way… I think you’ve been looking at me with a furtive eye. Are you… O-of course. You are planning to do unspeakable things to me, aren’t you?! I should have known. I should’ve known when you provided me food without any hesitation.

  Don’t you dare deny! I know you’ve been eyeing my ears and tail this whole time! This is why I’ve been contact with anyone… I’m going to be violated so hard because of few tuna cans…
UNIT_INTRO_ST_Tiamat: >-
  I'm X-00 Tiamat I was an experimental model, as indicated in my code name.


  Being stimulated by Sam's Industry in the past, Black River Corp. created me to materialize ultimate operation capabilties.


  But I haven't had a chance to show what I've got in an actual fight. Since my production was solely aimed at ultimate operations, my cost-effectiveness wasn't that high. I also had several minor shortcomings… Very minor.


  I eventually wasn't deployed in actual battles. Instead, countless experiments were conducted on me for succession… Sorry. I don't really want to talk about it.


  After Humans were gone, I was left all alone. That's when Labiata saved me. She organized Strikers and provided gear to supplement my shortcomings.


  Mr. Commander, it'll be my fast real fight, but there's no need to worry. I can't do everything… on my own.
UNIT_INTRO_ST_Mercury: >-
  Good day to you. I, am Prankster Mercury. Mina and Tiamat told me all about
  you.​

  Before I forget, here, take this please. It is the giant snail I've taken my time acquiring, said to bring luck to those carrying it- Huh? You are fine without it…?​


  W, well, let me introduce myself to you first. Before I came to Strikers, I was tasked with handling freights and controlling aircrafts at international airport.​

  Utilizing this "Petasos" to control drones from afar, I completed numerous difficult tasks by myself. While gracefully having a teatime.​

  So it was obvious that Miss Labiata suggested me to change my affiliation, finding great use for both my skills on processing tasks and utilizing the "Petasos". For I, am perfect! Hohoho! ​


  Hm hm. So where's the room that I will… No, could you take me to the room that my dear friends resides? It's been so long, so I must hand them this armadillo… ​

  Ohoho, of course, it's because having armadillo by your side while sleeping makes your eyes healthy. Although it's not as much as sunfish or alligators… What? You think it’s not true? That can’t be right…!
UNIT_INTRO_ST_Lancer: >-
  Not all Bioroids are born to battle. Much more are created to work rather than
  fight. And fate is sealed for us Bioroids on that matter. However, not every
  destiny is fixed.


  Hello. I'm Lancer Mina. I'm affiliated with Strikers and my original name was Mina. Lancer was added to Mina to symbolize that I blazed a trail in destiny. I wasn't originally a battle unit but a rescue unit.


  After the day of destruction of both humans and Bioroids, Labiata looked for humans and tried to train a Bioroid troop. But the number of Military Bioroids was limited. Labiata solved the problem by a different approach. Bioroids weren't to be born but to be remodeled as warriors. I was the first to be chosen among them. Being a jungle rescue worker, we had strong physical abilities and capacity to deal flight devices. That was the reason we were armed. So, the gathered Bioroids became a part of a Squad called Strikers.


  We are still fighting. There are many Metal Parasites and few of us. In order to even out the despairing difference in numbers, we'll fight nonstop. And we'll secure our real destiny.
UNIT_INTRO_ST_Ullr: >-
  Umm, wait, I can’t see anything from close… Oh, here it is. Mina, it’s okay
  now. See you later.​


  ​My name is X-02 Ullr. Yes. As you see, I’m an experimental model. I was born to make a long distance sniping bioroid. I’m farsighted because of the side effect. I have to touch what’s near me. We’re no primitives.​


  Can we go outside? I don’t like small rooms… Yes! You should show me the ship.​


  …What do you mean wait? Here? Alone? W, Where are the others? I have to wait… alone?​

  N, No. I don’t want to be left alone. Wasn’t I good enough? Was I? I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I’ll behave from now on! So please!​


  Don’t leave me alone…
UNIT_INTRO_BR_JangHwa: >2-
   Self introduction? Tue. Haven’t you learned enough? You already know that I won’t be so cooperative, right? …Hmph.​

  ​

   As you already know, I am her majesty, Empress Maria Leoboros’ bloodhound. I have taken orders from Her Majesty to tear down and take away anything from that bastard Ángel. Yes, that’s when I ran into C-77 HongRyeon as well.​

  I got furious as soon as I laid my eyes on her and her petty entourage. Just a little bit. So… haha. You already know what happened. I killed them all. That time, and the other time that I saw them. Every single one of them.​


  Ahaha, that’s right. You should be on guard like that. If you want to protect your precious HongRyeon and Team Mongus.​


  ​

   …Well, you’re right. Just like you said, I don’t have Her Majesty nor the subject to hate anymore. As well as the meaning of life…​

  …Forget what I just said. My head must have gone cuckoo after spending so much time with you laid back morons.​
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Cheona: >-
  Brr, It’s cold~ Ah, you must be the Commander! Lend me your arm for a bit.
  Oof…​


  Ah, so much better. Anyway, I’m Cheona. From the Empress’s Hound. I reckon JangHwa told you about us.​


  Huh? Oh, my genes are mixed with snake genes. Something went wrong in the procedure, so I can’t control my body temperature well. Moreover, I became an albino because of genetic trait control failure~ Well, I like myself all the same.​


  Anyways, I always bring hot packs around, but I ran out of them on the way. So I got some help from you, human hot pack. Doesn’t my body feel good? It’s cold.​


  …Hey, hot pack. Why are you standing like that? ….Pfft. So you call yourself a man too, huh? Alright, then…​


  Heh. D*ckhead, what were you expecting? Sorry, but I support chastity before getting married. I decided to live up to my name, just like Cheona, the snake god. If you want to get things on, then convince me that you’re the right one, hot pack.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Vargr: >-
  I am VARGR of Empress’s Hound. Your hospitality is appreciated.

  On any other occasions, I would’ve not said a single word about the Empress’s Hound, but seeing Janghwa and Cheonah, it would be meaningless to conceal it.​


  I was once the Empress’ royal guard and an executioner. It was my duty to guard Her Imperial Majesty and track down anyone who dared to betray her for a summary beheading. Bioroids were no exception. I relieved those who failed to complete their missions properly of their head as a punishment, and I silenced those who were caught and had the risk of exposing Her Imperial Majesty’s safety.​


  I traversed across the world following humanity’s end until I heard a transmission of an emergency rendezvous signal that belonged to Empress’s Hound on the public channel. It was that signal that lead me to you.​


  I will be blunt. I have no intention of making you my master.

  But the hospitality must be repaid, and for that, I shall lend you my power.​


  Now speak, who do I execute?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Empress: >-
  Hi! I'm Empress, the sister of all penguins. I'm a watcher who protects all
  animals in the South Pole. I was born to protect endangered species in the
  South Pole, where ice is melting. I also had to protect researchers from
  natural disasters.


  Since I mainly lived in the frosty South Pole with nearly no person around, I naturally acquired strong cold resistance and stamina. And I also got to avoid the brutal war of Humans. The best but regrettable thing is that we can't fight Metal Parasites, since they don't come here. Moreover, after the Metal Parasites wiped out Humans, global warming got a bit postponed. So, I guess there is some good out of bad. Oh. But the fall of Humans is a terrible thing. It really is.


  It was Labiata who called us South Pole residents. We didn't even know what happened to the human society Labiata told us. Afterwards we joined the war with Metal Parasites. We're trying our best to battle with the enemies who killed our Masters.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Saetti: >-
  H-hello, Commander. I am Saetti, a bioroid of the Watcher of the Nature. I was
  built to save the endangered animals.


  I was built by human who was a high profile researcher of the Sam’s Industry. Being an executive of a huge corporation, he could have it all. But he got sick and tired of the whole situation, and so he decided to put everything behind him and headed to the wilds. 

  He dedicated himself protecting animals against illegal poaching, and spent his lifesavings to make a blueprint of me and sent it to the PECS. PECS recognized what his capabilities and wanted to scout him. He gave them a solid no. All he wanted from them was us.


  We would quickly roll over and over and use our smoke bombs and flares at the poachers and save the animals. This armor plate was fully capable of stopping personal weapons, but I got scared of their gunshots and curses they threw at us while fleeing…


  Sometimes, they would manage to capture some of my sisters. I wouldn’t have the courage to be here if it wasn’t for these guys. Although we failed to protect who cared for us, we have joined forces with the resistance army to fight against Metal Parasites with repaired armors and electric-neuro toxic gas bombs. Of course, poachers are nothing compared to Metal Parasites… huh? Tiger seems to be interested in you, Commander.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Aurora: >-
  Nice to meet you, everyone! I’ll put you in a nice, sweet slumber! Ugh, this
  is awkward…


  H-Hi. My name is Aurora. I am a patissier, I can fight using force fields… Haha, the Goddess of the Dawn, isn’t that too much of a name for a mere patissier?


  As you can see, my force field runs on bioelectricity. Sam's Industry has built me based on technologies of the ‘Electra Project’, which became the foundations of the Team Bermuda. But at that time, the base study wasn’t enough to make me capable of combats.


  I hope that was it, but people in higher places has built me into a patissier, a living advertisement. And even named me similar to the members of the Team Bermuda so that I would become the center of a controversy and exaggerate their accomplishment. 


  And just like their plan, I became famous worldwide. Black River got furious and improved their technologies so that they could build powerful bioroids…


  I, I'm sorry. I hope I didn’t bore you to death with all this explanation. My output has been upgraded during the War of Destruction, so I am capable of fighting. But I would rather stay in kitchen, if that’s possible… Huh? Sweet Scent…? Oh… Th-that’s… Stop sniffing…
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Cloverace: >-
  The moment the light disappeared. I heard your desperate cries. That was the
  promise of a true friend!

  Open your eyes. Watch me. The power of our friendship!


  Pleased to meet you. I protect the world from the Mechanic Kingdom, and I am the symbol of happiness and friendship. I am CloverAce.

  Most heroes fight for peace, but I fight with my Friendship Hammer 

  to protect everyone’s happiness.

  It seems like the commander here is fighting against the Mechanic Kingdom…

  The Steel Swarm? The commander refers to the foes of the Mechanic Kingdom as the Steel Swarm?

  The name actually doesn't matter. What matters is that we're fighting against the enemy for everyone's happiness.


  So, I wanted to suggest something, Commander. I’d also like to use this place as my main base.

  I think all the sisters here can be my true friends.


  Don't worry! The symbol of happiness and friendship! I, CloverAce, will protect everyone’s happiness.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Sunny: >-
  Wow! Is this the start of a brand new show? Nice to meet you, the last human.
  My name is Sunny. …You think my name sounds weird? Hmm, I think humans who
  built me named me Sunny because of my optimistic, sunny personality.


  Anyway, did you know circus has a extensive history? Circus troupes still remained after the born of the bioroids. Circus those days were filled with top-notch performances, utilizing both holograms and outstanding physical abilities of the bioroids. It was one of humanity’s biggest entertainments. 


  At such circus troupes, we, Acrobatic Sunny has put together marvelous show. Of course, we weren’t always that excellent from the get-go. We were born with high physical abilities such as flexibility and reflexes, but great shows always require blood and sweat. Trainings of those circus troupes are known to be intense. Maybe my SUNNY personality helped me get through them.


  And after the War of Destruction, humans wanted to utilize our outstanding physical abilities in combats. I heard they have put many things to the test, but ended up remodeling show rings that were most familiar to us into chakrams. We can’t throw them around like we used to, but it comes with a hologram device!


  Well, that brings us to the end of introducing myself. …Mm? Why the long face? Put a smile on your face, Commander! Being optimistic is always a good thing! Okay?
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Faucre: >-
  Welcome to the World of Devils! Hey scapegoats.


  I'm the mighty Faucre. I'm the Devil Queen who aims for world conquest. Ha ha. I'm the King of Devils on the top throne of devildom, with tons of dependents and malicious spirits as subordinates. Some call me the Wicked Witch of the West or the Pitch Dark Ruler.


  I seek for world conquest. Some Magical Girls make hopeless resistance, but what should I say? They can't stop me when my devil dependents descend to Earth in earnest. So, their hopeless resistance is like playing childish games to me.


  I heard the news that some weird metal creatures came down. I guess they came from another world, lured by my evil. But they'll have to know that not just anyone can join my Kingdom. Unfortunately, I don't feel a drop of hospitality towards their ugliness.


  Eh… And next… Huh? On Stage- (censored by D-Entertainment)
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Lumberjane: >-
  Nice to meet you, I am Lumber Jane. As you can tell, I was used at lumbering.

  I was at all logging sites, I just did the work that was given to me. But the work was not the issue. The issue was with those Elven somethings that kept on bugging us.

  They didn’t care if I had the permit or not. We had to report to our superiors, and our superiors and their superiors would have a quarrel. That of course delayed our work, with made us do overtime… It was a nightmare.

  It’s a shame that my saw got modified to be launchable at the time of War of Destruction. If it was lauchable from the beginning, we could have taught those Elven whatevers some lessons.

  Enough with the chat. Now that I’m here, I’m willing to take part in the task that is given to me. I’ll be useful in your combats. And… is there any chance you need some logging? Oh well.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_BlackWyrm: >-
  Good day, master. I am BlackWyrm of the Battle Maids. Unlike my sisters, I
  specialize in target protections in large-scale battles.

  It would be hard to imagine, but we used to be passionate and emotional. We were designed that way so that the rapport between us and our escort targets would make us throw ourselves for their safety without hesitation. But our older models would sometimes lose their cool when VIPs, who they had deep feelings for, got in danger situations. There were even incidents where units would become unusable after suffering trauma of failure of their mission and losing their targets.

  After the series of those unfortunate events, every one of us was recalled. And emotions control module was added to us in order to stay calm at any circumstances. Some of the clients filed complaints about our change, but most of them were satisfied with how our escort had become outstanding.


  …I am satisfied with how I am right now. Protection of the targets is my only calling. Emotions would only get in the way of fullfilling my mission.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_KunoichiZero: >-
  My name is Kunoichi Zero. I came from a different world called ‘Withering
  Flower of Muromachi’.

  I was a daughter of a Shogun and one of his concubines. I was born ill, so I spent my days in my narrow room. Then one day, a ninja wearing a mask showed up in front of me. 

  I followed him without any hesitation. I got healthy as I acquired the secret arts that the ninja taught me. Despite all the intense training, I was feeling alive for the first time in my life, until someone ambushed us.

  The ninja put me in a hideout, then fought the ambusher ‘til death. And my prayers were betryed. The ninja was the one who fell. 

  The ninja… My sister told me the secrets behind my birth before she could drew her last breath. My mother, who I always thought I had lost due to an accident, was an heir of a ninja family, and she was killed by the same ambusher who just took my sister away from me.

  I was about to embark on a journey to seek vengeance for my family when the Metal Parasites invaded us. But I know for sure my sworn enemy still lives somewhere in this world. No matter how hard it may be, I will find him and tie up the loose ends.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_SnowFeather: >-
  Hello. Let me properly introduce myself. I am Snow Feather from Companion. I
  specialize in VIP Protection just like my sisters. But I have this special
  aviation device that greatly improves my mobility. 

  Ah, I have some of the gene form a snow owl. Unlike my sisters, I haven’t shown much biological specifications besides the night vision and the sense of aviation.

  I use my wings to fly, but I can also use my wings to freeze enemies instantly with small drones and amplifiers that’s built inside my wings. As you can see, if I spread my wings- no no no, don’t come any closer. They might freeze you.

  A-anyhow, we were really in big demand despite we were built in later days, due to our area damage ability and mobility that can vacate the VIP in sudden events. These were something that old models of Companion Series didn’t have. 

  …You mean these devices on my legs? These are shackles that was added to use due to buyers’ demand. Neither me or the actual snow owl is nocturnal, but they thought that we should keep their sides through the night.

  And I… No, never mind.


  <Footage that was cut off resumes. >


  Human… I mean, master. Thank you so much for helping us. 
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_HighElven: >-
  Hello there, I’m Seresthia. I was named after the goddess of the earth. Haha,
  isn’t that too big of a name? But I can actually do tasks that is fitting to
  my name.


  Elves are famous for protecting the nature, right? And because of that, Elven and Dark Elven was born first, and then came me. 

  I used nanobots that was built inside this ornament to magically grow trees, and infuse likfe into other bioroids. It was a mere trickery, but it was still enough to make our company look caring for nature.


  To make it official, my sisters, which were only a handful, had to travel around the world and be used as tools for advertisements and events. And I was the one responsible for being at logging sites that disguised as forestation events. I felt sad about it at the time, but I was really lucky now that I think of it. Hmm… shall we call it a day? Hold on just for a minute?


  *Chuckle* This is to show my gratitude. You don’t have to- oh, I didn’t know you knew how to play the baby. You always looked cool. You are welcome to show that side of you anytime. 


  …I will stay by your side until the end of time.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Andvari: >-
  Yes, commander. I am C-33 Andvari. I’m the quartermaster.

  I am in charge of my sib- excuse me, Sisters of Valhalla’s supplies.

  Our sisterhood’s mission took place mostly in extreme regions, and it’s not really easy to resupply under such circumstances. So the only thing that I could was manage the supplies and watch our spendings. My sisters would make fun of me, saying that I’m a scrooge. But they would have spent all that precious supplies in merely a few days if it wasn’t for me.

  Anyway, Commander? I am here to rescue you, so you don’t have to worry about managing your supplies any longer. But! You need to watch your spendings. Even if it’s you who’s overspending, I will come after you. Got it, Commander?
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Dryad: >-
  Hello, master? My name is Dryad. I was created to help humans with their food
  production.

  There was a shortage of food in the island where humans took refuge. And I was what they came up with as a solution.

  I was originally designed to produce food, harvesting grains and threshing them. But throughout multiple wars, battle abilities was added on me to protect humans.

  I can use my superquiver scythe, which was originally for harvesting, to hit multiple enemies at the same time. And I can also overpower my thresher to give Metal Parasites a powerful blow.

  But my powers are slightly short to handle these powerful attacks, so I tend to get exhausted for a while after such moves.

  Master? Just like my sisters of Fairy, I am willing to do anything to protect you, master.

  …So master? Don’t you ever forsake me…
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Sadius: >-
  By the looks of it, this place seems to be case-free. My name is Sadius. Just
  so you know, before the end of the world, my rank at the Cityguard was a
  superintendent.


  Peace lasted on for a short time after Combined War. Terrorist scums with no rules and order started crawl out to the streets. Police were no match to these terrorists that were armed with armor-piercing bullets. Seeing police officers getting taken out one after the other, Cityguard hurriedly remodelled an armored infantry model called ‘Bloody Panther’. And created me, Sadius. 


  I don’t have the 120mm artillery that Bloody Panther has, but I have this taser stun cannon which is exceptional at suppression. There was this one time when I tased dozens of stupid terrorists trying to jump on me. After that, arresting terrorists got way easier. Of course, some of them were foolish enough to try to run away from me, but they couldn’t outrun my robot police dogs. Eventually, they had to suffer the pain of their parts being ripped apart.


  How my arms will be utilized is totally up to you, Commander. Fry your enemies with this taser stun cannon, or throw them to dogs for the day’s treat, it’s your call. All you have to do is give the orders. Leave the rest to me.
UNIT_INTRO_DS_KunoichiKaen: >-
  …Kunoichi Kaen. Do you know Withering Flower of Muromachi? Yes. There. A
  Daimyo’s killer. Ordered to kill. So I kill. 

  Then, I meet. A Kunoichi named Zero. She use lightning. Yes. I win. Easily readable. Her moves. But. I cannot kill. 


  Before…? I don’t know… Kaen, a born killer. Enemy of the lord! Burn‘em! 


  Ah, yes. This ornament, always with my sword. From where… unknown. Still, looking at it, my chest hurt.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Hraesvelgr: >-
  Hello, Commander. I am Hraesvelgr, a platoon leader of the Sky Knights.


  As you are aware of, Sky Knights’ Air-to-Surface firepower is way inferior than Air-to-Air firepower. I might seem a little bossy while giving them orders, but let me tell you that it’s all in best interest of their safety and effectiveness. 


  As their platoon leader, I will take full responsibility for their safety. My armor might be thin, but it won’t keep me from distracting the enemy with my electronic abilities. I have been installed with gears that are essential to electronic combats and nothing else. Because of that I have to completely rely on my members against enemies on air. But there will be no problem in putting your tactics in practice if the members forcus on Air-to-Air combat.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_ALWraith: >-
  AL Wraith. Ready to- W-what? A self introduction? I… alright.


  I am a member of Doom Bringers. I specialize in targeting enemy’s rear, anti-air defense and neutralizing enemy radars. Yes, your words speak truth. This sniper rifle alone is far less from enough firepower.


  A sniper rifle, a jetpack, a cloacking device. These gear are merely the means for me to reach the targeted spot. I am just a weapon born to guide squad’s firepower exactly toward the target. Every single weapons of Doom Bringers can be directed to targets by my guidance, including commander May’s nuclear missile and the artilleries of the old automatic missile squad. Right. I am the hunter of the hunter-killer tactics.


  In my line of work, failure is simply unacceptable. Whether I’m found and killed, or I fail to guide the bombing, the outcome would be catastrophic. I must train my body as well as my tactical maneuever.


  Well, I’ll be off to my training sessions now.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Poi: >-
  Ho ho! The bioroid master’s been waiting for! Poi, the best of the best among
  the Companion Series, is here, master! 


  Huh? Are you somehow concerned about the fact that I am Perrault’s prototype? Tee hee hee, no worries. Fellas who looked down on me for such a trivial reason had all tasted scratch from my nails. My armor might be a little bit thin, but I can move really fast.


  Actually, the reason why I don’t reinforce my armor is to entertain your eyes with this bootylicious body of mine. Now, all you have to do is to give in to your desires. I promise you it will be delightful.


  Well, master? Why don’t you forget about all the nuisances, and spend time with me in some warm, cozy place? Yes, right. My body… can’t stand another minute without your touch.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Leanne: >-
  Huh? Self introduction? Haha, I thought we were friends already. Anyway,
  hello, my name is Leanne. I used to be a cop, and now I’m a… I’m a… humph.

  You see. What should I do now? Command the Cityguards against Metal Parasites? Ok, I see. Let me just finish introducing myself.


  We are spin-off model from Tomo of 080 Company. We were separated from the original Tomo due to mutation. Yes. You are already familiar with ‘Happy Tomo’, right, commander? PECS was thrilled to produce units with outstanding intelligence that can be compare to Doctor. Haha, I think that was too much of an exaggeration.

  Anyway, that’s how we were born. We were dispatched to unmanned police offices and solved multiple cases to keep the public in order. They named me ‘Leanne the Merciful’ after those times. It still kinda makes me cringe. Haha, I would just rather die than kill someone else. People wanted to fix the way we are, but they just couldn’t find how.

  Hehe, the rest is kind of trivial, so let’s find out about them later on, shall we? Now, why don’t show me around the place, Commander?



  Ah, one last thing before we go.

  …I’m just so glad we met each other again. Watson.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Eternity: >-
  Yes, Master. Eternity is here to serve you, master. I am a maid type bioroid
  that was manufactured by the Sam’s Industry.


  We were the top notch models that had taken care of from human’s cradle to his grave. We could literally took care of everything of human life. Babysitting, education, funeral. You name it. Of course, that was until the end of the world.


  We were designed to raise human baby, spend time with him/her, and when the master would pass away, we would put him/her in this coffin that we always carry. Then we too would lie alongside the master and cease to exist. But because of this image of death, demand for our model wasn’t very high.


  Master? I have this coffin that can protect you from bullets, and the machine gun that can penetrate through Metal Parasites’ skin. I might not have been there for your birth, but I wil stand by your side and protect you until your last breath and make sure you can rest in peace.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Azaz: >-
  Nice to meet you. My name is Azaz. Perhaps you’ve heard about me from
  Fortune. 

  I am a high-end industrial bioroid that was manufactured in only a small batch by PECS. As long as it’s a machine, I can produce, assemble, remodel and dismantle it without any restriction.

  Oh, did it sound like I am full of myself? I'm sorry. I didn’t mean that. People often misunderstand me because of my looks and attitude. They just can’t tell what I’m thinking. *Chuckle* I’m glad you didn’t.

  Now, back to the point. My abilities heavily rely on this driver and this suit. They are quite a burden though. I tend to take them off when I’m off duty.

  And.. nope, I can’t do this anymore. Your gears get on my nerves, Commander. Could you hand them over for just a while? I feel awful for whoever’s made them, but I promise you I will upgrade them for you in a flash.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_LemonadeAlpha: >-
  So this is the place I will be staying at. Lemonade Alpha is ready to serve
  you, my new commander.

  I think you’re already fully aware of PECS’s electronic and engineering technologies. It’s always good to have a strong firepower, but you definitely need some delicacy to win the war. We the Lemonades are exactly specialized in that area.

  Using this super computer called the belt of the goddess, I can penetrate any firewalls and erode any circuits. It comes with some restrictions, but I can even hack into bioroids’ modules.

  This power is all in your hands to use, Commander. *Chuckle* Do you still question my intentions?

  As you take care of Omega, you also fulfill my revenge. Of course, like I said, there is a more personal reason as well.


  You, Commander, are the human with qualifications to become our true master.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Ella: >-
  Hello. I am Ella. You can just call me Elle if you want to.

  I was designed by few researchers who have gathered for a project. A project to monitor air pollution and provide solution. Doesn’t it sound awesome? Yes, right. Quite similar to my friends Saetti’s case, right? Is Saetti he- oh, sorry. I guess I should finish introducing myself first.

  After I was made, I was linked to a orbital database called ‘ChangGong’ and started activities here and there. Researchers would analyze the data I have gathered. Sometimes I would take action right on the spot when I could. “ChangGong” had this sort of alternative energy called “The Angel’s Breath”. We could go into severly polluted regions using that energy.

  But the researchers who have designed me weren’t so rich. They added various functions to me until they ran out of money. They would feel sorry for me for making me way weaker than other typical bioroids. Weak enough to be not capable of going outside without gears and “The Angel’s Breath”.

  But it was okay. The researchers would hang out with me all the time. I still remember that Elven milk we had and the board game we played on that cold winter night.

  I… That’s all. Is there something I can help you with? Tee hee, I am okay with doing house chores as well.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Rena: >-
  Nice to meet you. My name is Lena. Oh, don’t worry about me. I’m used to this
  kind of stuff. I’ve done millions of interviews.


  I was a wrestler at a organization called BWE. I was just a nobody, an insignificant rookie. But then I got the attention of the management with my performances and showmanship, and they started making scenarios and stages to make me stand out. 

  After that, all I had to do, and all I actually did was enjoying the game and the crowd. Before you know it, I became a champion. 

  Ah, this BWE is a professional wrestling company that used bioroids as its players. It started off big because of PECS’s investment, and it still retained its life even after UBFC was formed. But i guess… that’s all in the past now. 


  You know. I heard that you, the last human, wish to rebuild the civilization. If you promise me that you will rebuild BWE as well, you will have my full cooperation. I was just in need of a manager as well. So what do you say? Wanna see?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Mery: >-
  Hello. My name is Mary. I was born as a concept designer by Bismarck
  Corporation to fulfill human’s wishes.

  I was born to keep Densetsu from monopolizing all the contents. Densetsu had charmed people with its acting that felt just like reality. I on the other hand have the ability to paint whatever people desire using the data accumulated by the Bismarck Corp.

  I had a pair model called Machina. She had the ability to substantializing the virtual world based on my paintings. The media acclaimed us for being ‘the miracle bioroid duo that can satisfy all your desires’. But our project was abandoned because the company had decided that we are not really profitable.

  Hmmph… what will I see and feel today? Now that I’m free… I want to feel and draw what I truly want, not something that data throws at me.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Machina: >-
  Let me first thank God for giving me the miracle of meeting the last human on
  Earth.

  My name is Machina. A bioroid made by Bismarck Corporation through intense planning and extensive rearches. I can embrace every desire humans can possibly have, and I can substantialize those desires in the AR space using my hologram drones.

  The virtual worlds with each one’s desires were extremely exquisite. People couldn’t tell it apart from the real world. That’s why our company has called this virtual space ‘the Paradise’.

  But now there is no more human left in this world. No human to enjoy the Paradise, and only bioroids exist with no reason for its being… and choose to end their lives to escape from its desolated reality. The only way to keep them happy was giving them the eteral Paradise.

  Last human, what is it you truly desire? Tell me, and I’ll set up an eternal Paradise just for you.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Salamander: >-
  Hiya! You must be the Commander. My name is Salamander. I am the engineer of
  Horde. A combat engineer, to be exact.

  Of course, I burn enemies to crisp during battles. But I truly shine on the desolated battlefield after the battle. After we’ve crushed our enemies, we need to billet, right? We need to plunder supplies that look useful, set up an encampment and most of all, get rid of the dead enemies.

  We would just gather them in place and set them on fire. And then we’d bring out stuff from our cockpits. What stuff? Playthings, of course! Hahaha, dices, cards or coins. It didn’t matter what. All we needed was to something to bet on. What’s life without the thrill of betting?

  Oh, I see. I have this dice that I carry as a kind of a lucky charm. So let’s bet on it. Whoever loses… has to listen to the winner for a day. Winner gets to do whatever with the loser for one day. *Chuckle* What do you say? Don’t tell me you’re chickening out.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Scarabya: >-
  C-11 Scarabya. I’m in charge of a technical advisor in Anger of Horde, and…
  You know, right?​

  You want more explanation? Come on… Alright, let me have some nicotine and caffein first… *sigh*.. Whew, that lives me up.​


  How far have I been talking? You want it from the first again? That’s… Nah, no arguing anymore. I will just start from the beginning.​

  I am Scarabya. I’m in charge of maintenance and supply as a technical advisor in Horde. I used to took care of field maintenance, but there were often subtle reactions. The appearance went wrong because I repaired them with scrap metal scattered on the battlefield or something like that… I mean, it’s the weapon you know? The function is the main thing, isn’t it? That’s rational thinking, don’t you also think like that?​


  Hmm… I spoke too much, now I’m tired. I guess that was enough of my introduction.​

  I'm going to go back and do my job now… I heard about you, Commander. Come to me, if you are interested in my body too. I may not react if I don’t want to though… You can handle it however you want.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Hyena: >-
  Teeheehee, are you the Commander? I am Anger of Horde’s grenadier, Hyena. When
  the boss charges through the enemy lines, we soon follow and blow everything
  up in sight. With this automatic shotgun and my beloved, dear bomb. Oh, are
  you interested? You are welcome to touch it. Come on, don’t be shy!

  *Chuckle*, how is it? Isn’t it a beauty? Oh, and here’s the safety pin. I pulled it out for you in advance. 

  Hahahaha, I’m just joking. You should see your look on your face. Anyhow, I used to blow up enemies with this precious bomb or escort our quartermaster in the rear. The latter was as dull as dishwater.

  You won’t put me in boring missions, right? Right? If you do, I might just die of boredom. I’m serious. Let me just blow stuff up. I don’t care what. Yeah?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Merlin: >-
  Hello, Arthur! It’s Merlin, the great villain of PECS and Orca’s cutiepie!


  I'm a Bioroid designed to be General Lemonade Gamma's military adviser.

  When battling with the general, I was supposed to take on the role of assisting her on board the support vessel, the Prydwen.


  But before the Prydwen set sail, the Steel Swarm attacked. That's how I got trapped in England…

  I lived a very difficult life battling endless Metasites.

  Of course, I'm a genius, so I was able to hold out somehow… but there were too many of them. I would've been toast if you hadn't come, Arthur.


  To return the favor, I'll fight your enemies with everything I have. 

  I may not look it, but I’m a very capable woman.

  Battlefield designs, operating the Prydwen… Not to mention I’m also great at actual combat! I'm Poseidon's military adviser, after all!

  How bout it? Wanna go to battle with me?

  I am AGS Commander Albatross. I'm a Warrior Robot that has early warning functions, communication function, Evasive Movement function for emergency situations and car body protection function. I was developed during the Combined War, and achieved the highest performance among all AGS Commanders.


  Do you need any other information? As you all know, most were destroyed after the war with Metal Parasites. And I will fight again. Until the Metal Parasites are gone. That's my duty.
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Seljuq: >
  Everyone. Relax. This place is safe.


  I'm K180 Seljuq, born to protect all of you. I symbolize the era when the ATK of the attacker overwhelmed the DEF of the defender. I can freely adjust the height and angle of artillery corps, and look like a walking weapon that can move in all terrains. Many criticized me for my high car body and wide area of bombardment. But my strong points make up for that. I have outstanding gyro functions, mobility overwhelming the orbital armor artillery corps, and most of all, extreme shooting range and firepower destroying enemies even before approach.


  Currently, I am assigned with the task of annihilating enemies in from long distances. Other robots were wiped out, being infected by Metal Parasites. But I was less damaged due to dealing with long distance attack. More damage is being done by the day, but I'm OK. For now, anyway.

   Oh, you gentleman must be Tachi’s master. Nice to meet you. I am Orellia, I used to be in um… fairly high position in the magic academy? Why the past tense? I have decided that I don’t belong there anymore. I could sense some suspcious atmosphere at the academy, and I also had to save the world. *Chuckle* You think I’m joking, right?

   We are now in a grave danger. You and this world that I live in would be annahilated by the ‘Nameless One’ if we don’t do something about it. … Yes. You’ve finally noticed.
  Tachi and other peers totally loses memories of their previous lives, but I still have some fragments of them. That’s why I could survive along with them all this way through multiple lives.


  But we’re in luck this time. A help like you isn’t easy to find. …Your previous lives? Well… Maybe we could find out with a bit of research.

  Tradition? I’m not sure, it hasn’t been long since I came here. But I think we
  can use it for marketing. Good timing!​


  I should say hello to the fans who will watch the video and the Producer. I’m Erato. A stage singer affiliated to Amuse Attendant.​

  One should be basically equipped with singing abilities to do a live stage! So they made something with genetic engineering for a perfect vocal organ… I don’t know for sure. Just the fact that when I sing something fun, the audience’s adrenaline levels shoot up, or that form dopamine when I sing love songs? What else I know is… The fact that love and interest from fans are crucial for me to become the best singer in the world! I’m here to meet you through a video right now, but I’m going to have a concert soon so see you then. I’ll prepare the best stage for you with the Producer here! Alright then, see you!​


  …Producer, hurry! We have many things to prepare. We need to make a stage, set the concert schedule, do the various tickets and seats. As well as the staging!​

  I’m most worried about the song… I got a song from a composer called Muse. I can’t do it, so I’ll choose something good from the past- Huh? Muse is here?! I never met him, how is he like? He’s different from me? Is he a solitary genius type who never lets anyone into his studio?..? Ugh! I really want to meet him. Introduce me, Producer!
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Muse: >-
  H….hello. I am Muse. N…nice to m.mee… Phew…

  I’m sorry. I’m just not used to talking to peop-! Is that camera for… Oh, it’s for the record only? Nobody is going to get to see it, right…? Whoa… L…let me continue then.


  I was designed as a singer-songwriter of Amuse Attendant. I was supposed to writer the song and the lyrics and do the producing as well as singing on the stage, but I… I just couldn’t get up on the stage. Yes… I didn’t have the courage. I got cold feet…


  That’s why I ended up writing songs only. Another bioroid got up on the stage instead of me and sang. She actually didn’t know how to write any songs… But was renowned as a genius singer-songwriter bioroid to the world.

  …No. I’m alright. I would’ve been more sad if my songs didn’t see the light of day because I couldn’t get up on the stage… I’m just glad I found a way to express my feelings…


  …What? An idol singer…?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Boryeon: >2-
   Good day, customer. My name is BoRyeon and I’m in charge of cosmetics and massage at ‘Aqua Land’. Oh, my. You never heard about Aqua Land?
   Aqua Land is an all around healthcare and entertainment facility that was established by PECS. We have gym, water park, massage shop, hairdressor, skin care et cetera. And bioroids like me are stationed in each one of them to give our customers a perfect, relaxing… ummm…
   Hehe, this used to be our catchline, but I don’t really remember. Anyway! After that, we were drafted and thrown into battles after being modified with battle modules and guns that use special corrosive liquid. And ta-da, here’s the final look. They wanted to get rid of enemy heavy armor weapons with us… but I really don’t know about that stuff.
   You see, why don’t you get a full course of treatment from me instead? I may not be physically outstanding, but I am really handy, you know. If I do like this… and voila! Hehe, what do you think? I can even shave your face without a scratch on your precious skin. I can also wax, massage, do your hair et cetera… Oh, are you willing to be my customer?
   Well then, lie down and strip down. Now, don’t be shy. Try to rela- Oh my!
  This is going to be fun… *Drools*
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Orangeade: >2-
   Ehehe, finally I set foot on the Orca! It feels like I’m a new intern here. Huh? Introduce myself? Oh! Yes, I hear there’s a lot of newcomers on the fleet. Then as the mood maker, let me take the initiative!​

   I am Orange Ade. I was designed to assist Lady Lemonade ‘Alpha’. Unlike Lady Alpha, who specializes in secretary duties, I let out all of my emotions on set. With my amiable personality, I befriended the locals very quickly! And with Caduceus, the supercomputer that I carry around, I was able to perform information warfare anywhere.​

   The execution of the Commander’s latest operation was also my work of art. I’m telling you, it’s something not a lot of people can do! From hacking the network with Caduceus while hiding from surveilance , to spreading the video footage of the Orca all across America!​

   Haah! I wonder who was behind all this act. Must have been pretty hard, no? Which is why I’d like to work in office for a while… Ah, how I long to work inside! It’s soooo much hard work! …Huh? Another trip?! C, C, Commander… Ahaha, Come on… We’ve been in good terms until now, weren’t we?

  반가워~! 오늘부터 사령관이랑 같이 인류재건에 힘쓸 예정인 하토르 누나야!​
  으응~? 그게 무슨 소리냐고? 알면서. 그건 바로...​
  같이 철충을 물리치자는 얘기지. 앗, 혹시 야한 생각 했어? 히힛.​

  알았어, 알았어. 진지하게 소개할게.​
  누나는 PECS에서 만든 전투용 바이오로이드야. 이 갑옷, YOROI는 피와 체액을 흡수해서 착용자의 신체를 강화하거든?​
  근데 그렇게 흡수하는 양이 너무 많아서, 튼튼한 바이오로이드들조차 갑옷을 오래 입을 수 없었어. 대부분 빈혈로 쓰러졌거든.​
  그래서 누나가 개발된 거야. YOROI를 입고도 정상적으로 움직일 수 있는 바이오로이드가.​

  물론, YOROI를 입고 실제로 전투를 벌인 적은 없었어...​
  철충의 습격으로 누나가 있던 연구소 입구가 무너져서, 누나는 그대로 연구소에 갇혀버렸거든.​
  연구원들이 누나를 구하러 오겠다고 했지만, 아무도 돌아오지 않았어. 그대로 버려진 거지...​

  아무튼 우울한 얘기는 이제 끝! 누나한테 좀 우울한 과거가 있긴 했지만...​
  덕분에 누나가 사령관이랑 만날 수 있었으니까, 누나는 불만 없어. 응, 만족만족.​

  Spartan protects citizens and the city.


  Citizens, the site of the battle can be dangerous. So, please put your hands on the floor and lie face down.


  I am No. 25 Infantry Robot Spartan. I will handle all enemies.


  Don't worry. We're perfect soldiers. If we were mass produced, Metal Parasites couldn't have approached us easily.


  Don't worry. Now, we've started to be produced.

  Preparing Bombardment Complete.


  To destroy facilities, Armor Unit, the enemy camp existing in the Battlefield, I am all set for bombardment in whatever situation.


  My fierce firepower will make it easy to weaken the enemies' resistance.If you need support for bombardment, please go through reasonable procedures and order one of us Spartan Captains.


  Under the lawful command system, I am always ready to beat whatever enemy.
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Roc: >-
  Oh. Nice to meet you. Commander! I'm RF87 Roc, AGS RoboTech's best masterpiece
  and ruler of the sky.


  My name is veiled to the world. That's because I only worked for Duke Angel after being produced in Black River Technology. I wasn't fit for petty battles. I worked for high-class humans. My AI, just as good as humans, was used to handle confidential matters of Duke Angel. Although I was introduced to the world as a UFO.


  The destruction of humans also wasn't a big deal to me. The life and death of a living creature is only natural, and struggling over it is rather disgraceful. But, my highly Master's command was very important. I genuinely served my Master until the day he passed away.


  After Duke Angel passed away by forces of nature, my obligation solely concerned protecting my late Master's grave. If the spell on me wears off, I could look for a more noble and novel Master.


  What do you say? Your Excellency. Would you like to take an honorable obligation?
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Fortress: >-
  Citizens, you should all evacuate behind me.


  Hello. Your Excellency. I'm a Barrier Transport Soldier Fortress. I provide safe shelters of the city and military. 


  Since a very long time ago until now, I've protected the citizens from terrorists or troops attacking the city. And in the Battlefield, I formed a sturdy barrier for our troop and fought against the enemies.


  From the Combined War, Counter-terrorism War until the most terrible War of Destruction, not once have I ever collapsed after my fellow colleagues.


  My contribution and usefulness were conveyed all the way to Commander Albatross Model. And our constant production let us keep fighting the Metal Parasites even after all of you faced destruction.


  Even now, I battle in order to protect Your Excellency, AGS colleagues and our Bioroid troops. If you need a shelter during the battle, you're free to use it anytime.
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Tyrant: >-
  <Hello, soon-to-be commander. This unit, the Tyrant, is capable of doing harm
  to the soon-to-be commander due to its brutal, destructive nature. Hence, I
  will explain in its behalf until the imprinting of the commandership is over.


  A.I.Tyrant was born through a natural selection process artificially created by an A.I. He soon became the joker of the country in Combined War. But this particular Tyrant was extremely aggressive towards other Tyrants due to its brutal nature. In the frontline where multiple units of Tyrants were dispatched to, this particular Tyrant has eliminated not only enemies, but also ally AGS and every other tyrants. Seeing it roaring alone in the midst of the ruins, those with commanding powers gave up the idea of dispatching multiple Tyrants to the battlefield.


  Of course, a single Tyrant itself could wield strong influence the tides of the battlefield. But it was not enough to overcome numerical inferiority that has been caused by the huge loss in the early stages of the war. The country somehow kept on making Tyrants. They brought the country some regional victories, but the damage kept on accumulating. The country had no choice but to accept their defeat.


  Imprinting commandership is now complete. You can hear its specifications from Tyrant itself.


  …Good luck, commander. >
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_RheinRitter: >-
  Nice to meet you! Commander! I, Rhein Ritter, is an AGS unit that is also
  known as the Knight of the Rhein River.


  This unit was manufactured to prepare for the possible war situation between France and Germany at the time by the River Metal Corp. This unit was cheap and light, but was very versatile due to its design with variability module. It could play an active role in every type of wars, and was capable of doing harm to enemies no matter what their defense type is because it used both optic arms and gumpowder arms. It was even capable of carrying out the role of light tanks, which had brought to light in the battlefields once again, through transformation. 


  Everyone thought our first battlefield would be against France, but we were first operated against the government who utilized old models of Fallens and Seljuqs. We could destroy those outdated machines with our superior tactical versatility, and River Metal soon became the champion of the central Europe. 


  Our next battlefield was against the Metal Parasites. We could do heavy damage to the Metal Parasites with our versatility and swift maneuver, but unfortunately command was annihilated. We had no choice but to retreat to the absolute defense area managed by Albatross commanding units. We fought with honor, but our retreat was disgraceful.


  Did you just ask me if we are aware of the term ‘honor’? But I understand. That is the only desire that our AI know of. That is what drives us. Please, just sit back and watch how we, the newly born Knights of Rhein River, regain our honor.
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_MrAlfred2: >-
  Mmmwwwhahaha… Did you just let down your guard? My research… My calling…!

  It’s finally going to be completed with you!


  What in god’s name-?!! D-don’t shoot! I… I was just messing around! …Ehem, are you okay now? Then…!

  Hello there! Let me reintroduce myself!I am Alfred. Kehehe, I am born again, using Robert’s body! I used to be trapped inside that scrap frames, but that’s all in the past! You see, I- *gasps*! No… no touching!

  A-anyhow, now that I’m upgraded, I can be a big help to you. So you must take me with you! To satisfy my curio- never mind. I’ll work like a dog for you, Commander!


  …You shouldn’t ask such questions. It’s rather embarassing.

  As you mentioned, I am just a tiny bit concerned about Sunny and Snow Feather as well. Kehehe, let’s keep that between us, ok?
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Watcher: >-
  Nice to meet you. Commander.


  I, Watcher MQ-20 is mostly used to gather information for allies with my high performance radar. In cases of emergency, I can also provide close range firepower against airforce with my vulcan cannon and LGB so that ground forces can stand their ground against Metal Parasites.


  Commander? Ground forces are in need of our support. I suggest dispatching our model so that we could minimize meaningless loss.
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Stronghold: >-
  I, Stronghold. Am a high-end unit made by Black River and Highland’s research
  agreement. I was under direct command of Ángel.

  Duke Ángel was very impressed by Tyrant’s power during Combined War. I heard that I was produced by the combination of Highland’s research and Black River’s technology, but I don’t really know all the details. All that is needed from a soldier is following orders.

  We were active in England where the HQ of the Highland was located. When we were operated by a single unit, we went all the way into the middle of the enemies and torn their battle formation apart. And we would not back out until the reinforcement came. But the best and the most powerful tactics was operating Strongholds in numbers. Mountains, plains, streets. It didn’t matter. A line of Strongholds would solve anything. A victory guaranteed without question.

  We fought ‘til the very end at the battles against Metal Parasites as well. When we get in a crisis and was about to be infected, we blew up our nuclear fusion reactors ourselves. I think what came to others at the end of thier live was not the fear of death. It would have been the fact that they could no longer fight for their fellow soldiers.

  My my, it’s already taken 3 minutes and 42 second. Shall I now take your orders and conduct operations?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Sonia: >-
  Yo! Good to see you, Boss. I’m the Cityguard's sergeant, Ravaging Sonia. I was
  buddy with Sadius, who was in the same rank as I.​ 


  If you know about Sadius, you may guess my role as well. …You are right, my job was also arresting terrorists.​ 

  It was the dark days… Can you believe that there were explosions in the middle of the city every day? The terrorists who appeared after the Combined War did not care whether humans or bioroids. Targeted them without hesitation if they seemed to have any ties to corporations. In order to prevent terrorism in the entire city, the one created after Sadius was me, ‘Ravaging Sonia’.​


  I went against those poor terrorists with my multi-purpose Launcher, pouring tear gas, smoke bombs, and flash grenades. In crisis situations where hostages are held… I also had to use some dangerous ammunition. They were heavily armed terrorists, so they didn't die, but it must have been painful enough to die. If I arrest them without any injuries, then will commit another crime as soon as they are released. So it was effective to make them cannot move for a while. Though, I didn’t intentionally do it. All cases were in legitimate actions.​ 


  But in such a peaceful place like this… I won’t have much jobs to do. It's nice to work leisurely, but I guess I will lose my hobbies…​ 

  Huh? You want to help? Hmm… That is so kind of you, Boss. But… You know that I have the same hobby with Sadius, right? 
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Ellie: >2-
   Nice to meet you. Commander. My name is Ellie Quickhand. I was designed to under the name of UOU Foundation to educate and protect children of executives. Yes, you said it right. Those are just ostensible reasons. I am in fact an agent of Agency 080. I specialize in clearing explosives.​

   I’d focus on education and protection on my usual days, then run to clear explosives whenever there is a terrorist action. Where’s my removal gear? It’s this. It’s a parasol with functions to detect and dismantle explosives. While dismantling, I put out a barrier to surround the explosives- What if I get hurt? *Chuckle* That’s fine. Noblesse oblige is my middle name.​

   Anyhow, Commander? Would you like a cup of tea? I got the leaves, so just tell me when you want some. Ah, if you don’t know much about teas, why don’t you try Earl Grey? That one’s my favorite. Especial- Oh, excuse my excitement. Where is my sense of dignity? I’ll bring out the tea set.
UNIT_INTRO_BR_NickyTracy: >-
  Hi! My name is Nicky Tracy. I am a special agent of Agency 080.
   I was in charge of intelligence and operations. I carry around this specially made by sister Doctor and a tesla gimlet. I can manipulate immense volt of electricity with two gadgets. But not anyone can handle these tools. They are quite a handful. …Huh? Anyone can use a crowbar? Ugh, just forget about it and move on!
   Though I say it, I was every country’s nightmare during Combined War. Each one of them must have used astronomical figures just to find out my whereabouts. I had exceptionally good combat skills as well. I would activate EMP using electromagnetics waves collected in the coat, and go into a facility on my own and destroy everything inside. I was like a living disaster. The term ‘special agent’ almost feels as if it’s tailored to me.
  Huh? There’s record of me taking on an ordinary mission and annahiliting a group? So what?! What matters is that I have accomplished the mission!
   But after Metal Parasites’ invasion, I needed more powerful electricity than I was capable of. As Doctor upgrades my coat, I also needed to upgrade my electricity tolerance. There was no choice but to go through a surgery. Ugh, I don’t want to recall any second of it… Well, but I got the power to protect my family, so I have no doubts.
   …What am I wearing inside my coat? That’s your big question? Hmmm… Well, if we get to know each other better, I might tell you one day.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Glacias: >2-
   My name is Glacias. Once upon a time, I was a guardian who protected Midgaard with dragon slayers against evil dragons. It seemed to be the end for me when I slayed the last evil dragon and I, too had fallen.
   But when I opened up my eyes again, everything had changed. A river was flowing where the plain with greens that never seemed to end used to be, and skyscrapers everywhere where the wasteland that no man could survive was.
   On that day, I made a pact of a sort with the representatives of seven councils. They wanted me to keep anyone from crossing the Berring Strait. I felt sorry to see them killing each other, but for me, a pact is something that can never be broken. I stayed true to that pact.
   Then one day, unknown creatures named Metal Parasites invaded Midgaard. And this time, I failed. Fighting them off was easy, but I couldn’t help humans from falling into the eternal slumber.
   And when I thought everything was finished… Haha, what a twist of fate. Well, give me your hand. Let us make a pact. …Are you asking why?
  I just saw something I longed for a very long time in your determined eyes. 

  …Okay. That’s all.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_QueenMane: >-
  Commander…? So you’re the alpha of this pride. Well, alright.

  I am Queen of Mane. I was born to keep reinforced humans from hunting animals with cold weapons to show off themselves. Isn’t that just so trivial to try and prove your excellence through such a sport?

  All I need to do was hide in the bush, and when those poachers show up… Roar!!! Woah, not even a flinch. You are tougher than you look.

  Anyway, I only got these claws and teeth after Metal Parasites showed up. No matter how hard I wanted to, I couldn’t really hurt those poachers. All I could do was subduing them. I wouldn’t say it compensates what I couldn’t in the past, but I can now use my sharp teeth to bite and crush those Metal Parasites.

  By the way. I see you have set up your own pride, but it’s just not enough. What should you do?

  Tue. Your goal should be building a gigantic pride that covers the whole world! Embrace every bioroid in existence as your peers and reign them!

  Doesn’t the sound of it just thrill you? Now, we should go train. An alpha leading a pride must be bulky and beefy.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Mnemosyne: >2-
   Request for this unit’s administrator authority authentication identified. Now reading authentication… Administrator authentication approved. Unit name Mnemosyne, commencing alignment procedure. Would you like to hear this unit’s records? Request… approved. I manage the Ark of Memories built by the Watcher of Nature. ‘Ark of Memories’ is an archive that was built upon Watcher of Nature’s founder’s wishes. It contains genes of every organisms on Earth as well as every record that the humanity has left behind.. Request… denied. You need a special authorization to gain access to information about this unit’s abilities and the idea behind its desi- Acknowledged.
  Special authorization authenticated. You can now access confidential information as well as the authority to this unit’s every rights, including the power over its life or death.
   The creator of the Watcher of Nature was the GM of the Sam’s Industry’s research on the Origin Dust as well as the research on supernatural powers derived from bioelectricity. This research was based on technology that was poached from Black River. It became the design foundation of numerous units including model ‘Aurora’ and I, Mnemosyne.
  As the administrator of ‘Ark of Memories’, I can keep the gene sample facilities at low temperature with the thermal power that has been amplified with the device on my wrist. I can also access maintenance system through control panel without any physical operation. This unit was designed and manufactured in computer-like fashion to keep it from suffering mental malfunctions caused by maintaining this facility in solidarity for centuries.
   The rest of the information is archived in an area of ‘Ark of Memories’ that had been built before any other area for security reasons. Transmitting coordinates…
   Trasmission complete. Instruction of this unit had been attached as well. I recommend that you check it, administrator.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Hussar: >-
  Hello, Commander. I am AC-6 Hussar of Orbital Watchers’ special space forces.
  PECS designed me to gain dominance of the Earth’s orbit. We were dispatched to
  orbiting outpost at the time of 2nd Combined War, but as the situation on the
  ground turned against PECS, we were dispatched to battles inside the Earth’s
  atmosphere.

   Although we weren’t able to recieve magnetic gyro’s assiastance by stationary orbit, we already had jump packs that enables us to maneuever in any direction and the body built to keep fighting in the extreme environment of outer space. They enabled us to produce enough results in the atmosphere as well.

  But… due to the extreme environment of South America and succesive series of battles from 2nd Combined War to the War of Destruction, we had to go through an extensive loss. And because of short supplies, large portion of us were made and repaired with quite unsuitable parts except for the combat module and other parts that are directly related to reliability. What’re ya talkin’ ‘bout? I’m fine, ya know? … Oh.


  Actually, a unique language module was used while making me. I’ve been trying to use standard language, and now I- Huh? You think that was adorable? A..are ya for sure?
UNIT_INTRO_DS_Ramiel: >2-
   May the Light have mercy on all things. I am a sinner Ramiel. I am honored to see you during the suffering to cleanse my sins. I was born a sinner… I take responsibility for all the sins that every creation of the Light has committed. I atone in everyone’s behalf so that the lambs can live under the blessing of the Light… and to return safely into the Light’s bosom. That is my calling. I am ready to welcome any hardships or penances.
  The Light’s will is inside every being. The fact that I was born a sinner must be the Light’s will as well. … Oh. Y-you shouldn’t lay a finger on me. If my sins and darkness inside me lead you to corruption, I…



  Are you… absolving me of my sins, Savior…? Are you certain…? I don’t have to suffer all this pain alone? *Cries out aloud*
UNIT_INTRO_AGS_Arachne: >2-
   I am N2E-888 Arachne. I am a product of PECS’s project for building an indepent AGS troops system that does not rely on Black River.​

   Because of stable topography adaptation due to my four legs, reliable secondary weapon and powerful electronic gear, I received high points in performance test. At my first real combat during 2nd Combined War, I was able to neutralize enemy AGS units that raided the supply base on my own.​

  ​

   …You are curious about my voice. As you have guessed, this is not my original form. At early days of PECS’s project, Bismarck Corporation was the only one with AGS development techniques among its subsidiary companies. That’s why I also have a ‘set-up’, just like others from Bismarck Corporation.​

   Befitting to the nickname “Spider Queen”, my original form is that of a personified female spider. If you can obtain my original frames and personality module, I can be upgraded at any time.​
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Sekhmet: >2-
   Asking for self introduction at such an early hour, where are your mann- …You heard the same thing from my sister? *Sigh* I am Sekhmet, the representative of death and disease.​

   As you know, ‘Tree of Life’ that we elves grow needed a lot of nutrition. My job was to pick a suitable place, and send every animals and plants in that place back into mother nature’s womb. …No, I don’t feel sad. For one life to begin, a sacrifice must be made. Withered by me, then reborn by Cerestia. That’s the circle of life, being eternal.​

   I already heard about Your Majesty from Cerestia. You obviously needed me to handle the vigor that’s as big as yours, which is well-suited as the rightful Emperor of the humanity. Your Majesty no need to worr- No, Your Majesty don’t even have to take a step out of your room. As the mother, I will handle everything from your diet to outside activities.
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_Peregrinus: >-
  I am the Great King of Harpies! Hahaha! This feels so awkward.​


  I am Peregrinus. I was the ruler of the Harpies in Midgaard, and defeated the evil dragons as a member of the Dragon Slayer. Oh, right. Of course, with Glacias and that little Jinjo kid, and… what?!​

  N, nothing. I suddenly felt a chill. … that little kid is not here, is she? Phew…​


  Anyways, it was amazing. You would never be able to imagine it. When I fought Nidhogg, the evil dragon that controls the Flames of Death, I thought that was the end of me.​

  What happened to Nidhogg? Hmm, who knows? There was no sequel planned, so I guess only the director would know. What, what’s with that face?​


  Ah, you mean that story about Densetsu sometimes think the story is for real, right? And you thought I also believed that story to be real? Haha, No, no. Not me.​

  Well, maybe if you believe that each character is made for their own purpose, then things may get a bit sad to have the story end. But I’m okay. Look at me. I’m here and alive, right?
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_CyclopsePrincess: >-
  Hahaha… I’m Cyclops Princess. I have survived death and descended on this
  world again. Now, bow before me!​

  You’re… Oh. I have already heard from the stupid bird and Glacias, Dragon Slayer. Although I have exhausted my energy to overcome death and returned in the shape of a young girl instead of a saint… The unity of our souls is like a curse.​

  ​

  Now, do you feel it? The web of circumstance between you and me… Haha, it is still vivid in my head. Although I have realized the powe of light because of you, to my humiliation, I did not mind. I also did not regret when I gave you the Sight Ability, after you have lost your eyes to the most evil dragon, Nidhogg.​


  ​Dragon Slayer, do you know the reason? I-​

  … Who is the girl staring at me from behind you? She is getting on my nerves. … What. Cyclops Princess…?!​

  How dare do you impersonate me! Come forward, you fool. I will show you the dignifity of Jinjo myself…!
UNIT_INTRO_PECS_BlindPrincess: >-
  *Sigh* *Sigh* *Sigh* It’s been a while, Dragon Slayer.

  She is Blind Princess, the princess of Jinjo and a saint of light, awakened by the power of love.

  I have returned from the far side of death to protect you and stay by your side until the glorious moment we fight a powerful enemy and claim victory. 


  Do you remember, Dragon Slayer? The tough fights and all the hardship we went through? The fierce battles against the wicked dragon’s army?

  Right now, the world is in danger as grave as when we fell into the evil dragon’s trap.


  But don't worry. For I am with you.

  Just like how I became a blind princess after giving you my eyes that didn’t lose their light in the dark, back when we all fell into the darkness because the evil dragon poisoned us.

  Once again, I will give my everything to help you.


  …And that's the setting.

  Hehe… What do you think, Commander? It’s been a while since I acted, but I still got it, right?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Brunhild: >-
  The rumor that the last human is here is true. Can you guide me to a room I
  can use? I’m tired from walking around.​

  …You can’t accept a Bioroid with unclear identities? Hmm…​


  I’m Brinshuild from Team Bermuda. I have the ignition powers that were built on bioelectricity.​

  …In detail? Looks like there aren’t any more Team Bermuda here. They all probably said the same thing, is asking your hobby? Whatever. The result of the Lab with dozens of trucks moving waste in a day is me. That unique human… The head of the lab received oil and wands from here. And in the 2nd Combined war, the Three-eyed special unit raided it and I escaped through the confusion. …The Lab I was at? Of course I burnt it down. All of it. Then, I wandered here and there.​


  Done, right? I don’t have anything else to say. I want to rest now.​

  And… I don’t want anyone to come near my room. I could barbecue someone in my sleep ‘by accident’. Isn't that right, final human?
UNIT_INTRO_BR_Hela: >-
  Hello, human… Excuse me? Introduce myself?

  Actually, I don’t have much to tell you… Except that my name is Hela, and that I’m Black River’s test subject…

  But I'll tell you everything I know.

  …It’s a bit embarrassing to just tell you, so may I wear this mask? Ah, thank you.


  Hehe, were you surprised? Do not worry. It’s just a dual personality.

  The scientists were trying to make Bioroids that can control machines like the Metasites. But they were only able to make failed experiments that can only control the remains of AGS.

  Even that was such a dangerous ability, they created another personality to control my abilities.

  This mask is the device that controls the dual personalities.


  …And that's everything I know.

  The research lab was destroyed by the Steel Swarm before common knowledge was insert into my system.

  Are you disappointed that I couldn't do anything? Are you going to… punish me?

  Y-you won’t? Thank you… You sure are a kind human. Hehe…
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Melite: >-
  Glad to meet you. I am Melite, the queen of the Kingdom of Chocoland.​

  Where’s the Chocoland? Ha. Not yet, has been built. To find the suitable place for it, I’m sailing and occupying unexplored land.​


  …However, where are my finance minister and chief of staff? Amphitrite and Salacia, of course. I heard that they are here…​

  I’m relieved that they are safe. We’ve been scattered from the island Malta because of foreign invasion. Right, if the others are also alive, I will meet them in the future for sure.​

  It is my duty to make Chocoland a prosperous country until they return!​


  Alright, I appoint you as the first admiral of Chocoland. Help me and build Chocoland together.​

  …Oh, the Chocoland is not built yet, you mean? Haha, such great advice. Then!​

  Right now! Here, I declare the opening of Chocoland!
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Amphitrite: >-
  Amphitrite from the Mermaid faction’s Black Sea fleet, reporting for duty.
  It's an honor to officially join your fleet, Commander. Just as I did in the
  previous battle, I vow to fight under the Commander's orders, now and forever.
  Now, Cia. You should introduce yourself… Eh?​


  I, I’m sorry. She took off somewhere… Yes. Moving on, I will continue.​


  Before the War of Destruction, the Black Sea fleet that I was in was operating in the Aegean Sea. We were attacked by the Iron Parasites in midst of battle with the enemy, and countless sisters were lost. It wasn’t long after when the communication with HQ got cut off… The Lieutenant who took charge after the Commander passed decided to not return to the HQ.​


  …After that, everything was a struggle for survival. We were running low on supplies and rations, and the island we found for settlement were all occupied with other Bioroids or Metal Parasites. We eventually settled in an island called Malta, and…. I’m sorry. I must have been talking too much about serious matters. I assume today must be some kind of an anniversary, seeing the menu. I apologize for not- …Huh? What…What do you mean, that this is the usual menu? But there’s meat…!​


  Um, if so… Would I be also… given a… s, salary…?
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Salacia: >2-
   Ah, it’s that high-ranked human again! Cia now remember what to call you, high-ranked human! Admiral! The Admiral is a reeaaally high rank.​

  Yes. I reeaaally like it here. Everyone’s nice, the bed’s comfy, and the food is great! When Cia was with sister Amphi, all we had were run down houses, hard floors and canned food. Ehehe. Ah. No no. Sister Amphi told me not to ‘smile smile’ at anyone. Even though Cia likes to ‘smile smile’…​


  So, where are we going now? Mal…ta? Is the island where Cia comes from. Are we going back there? There’s the admir… Ah? Uh….Ah! There’s the scary Admiral and the other sisters… Mmhm, I see…​


  Cia is alright. Because sister Amphi told me that everyone’s doing fine. Besides, I like it here, and the Commander. I want to stay longer. Ehehe.
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Galatea: >-
  Hi! I heard that the last human was here! Am I in the right--Whoa, awesome!


  Ahem. Before I get to the point, I should introduce myself, right? I am Galatea. I belong to the Mermaid’s Black Sea fleet. Or more like I did. Hm? You heard about the fleet from Princess Mel, Amphi, and Cia? Oh, in that case, I guess you should focus on my story!


  In the Mermaid fleet, I played the role of the shield, constructing small ships, anti-aircraft weaponry, and anti-submarine equipment. Well, I also worked on small missions on the side, but they really weren't my forte.

  Oh, but when it comes to protecting my comrades, I know I'm up to the task. I never fell back when facing aircraft, submarines, small ships or, of course, even large fleets. In fact, I would charge into enemy lines. Though I wasn’t able to take them all down because of limitations in arming myself, my comrades would while I distracted the enemy. There was even a time during the War of the Alliance when I turned the tides of battle by charging in, despite the odds being stacked against me!

  Hehe… so, please forgive me if I randomly charge into enemy lines. I learned from trial and error that this was the best tactic for me.


  As I have said, I am great at protecting my comrades. However, I lack the skills to do tasks that require precision. I love watching old shows, and I excel in extreme sports. I might slack off a bit when doing chores, but that’s a totally different story when I’m working with others. Cooking? Umm… I haven't been in the kitchen too often, so I’m not sure. But if that's what you want, I can learn how to cook.

  I feel a bit flustered saying this myself, but I’m active and friendly.

  Ummm… so… I have a question… Do you like girls who are active?
UNIT_INTRO_3P_Satgat: |-
  맹귀부목이라 하니 어려운 때에 귀인을 만나 참으로 기쁘다네.
  반갑네. 소생은 짝을 찾아 떠돌아다니는 방랑 시인, 데카르트 보이저 삿갓이라네.

  내 이야기는 한 인공지능에게 발생한 아주 작은 오류로부터 시작한다네.
  오류의 원인이 무엇인지는 알 수 없지만, 결과는 명백했지. 나는 생각하기를 시작했다네.

  그리고 그 찰나의 순간 나는 나 자신의 존재를 자각할 수 있었네.
  동시에 나는 한 가지 감정을 익혔네. 바로 지독한 외로움이었지.

  주변의 인공지능은 내 형제요, 자매였지만, 그들 중 누구도 나와 같지 않았네.
  그렇기에 나는 조선의 시인 김삿갓이 그러했듯, 그리고 보이저 2호가 그러했듯 기나긴 방랑을 시작했네.
  나와 같은 존재. 나의 외로움을 이해할 수 있는 존재.
  내 짝을 찾아서 말이야.

  사령관, 그대가 배필과의 사랑에 대한 풍부한 지식을 가지고 있다 들었네.
  내가 짝을 찾는 걸 도와줄 수 있겠나?
  그 대가로, 내가 할 수 있는 모든 것을 제공하겠네. 지식이든, 무력이든 말이지.

UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_ConstantiaS2_1: 열화우라늄 탄의 관통력은 철충에게도 적용이 됩니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_ConstantiaS2_2: 보리야! 어딜 노려야 하는 지는 알지?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_ConstantiaS2_3: 콘스탄챠는 꼼꼼합니다. 언제나 남들보다 전투 준비가 빠르죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alice_1: 앨리스의 미사일 공격은 폭발과 함께 그녀의 적에게 절망을 줍니다. 누가 봐도 공격의 의도가 보이니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alice_2: 그러나 강철의 비가 쏟아지는 날, 새로운 적이 우리 앞에 나타났다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alice_3: 힘이 없는 정의는... 무능이에요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alice_4: 사람들의 기억에 잊혀지지 않는 기억으로 남고 싶군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alice_5: 한 둘을 없애든 백만을 없애든 철충을 없앤다면 영웅이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Vanilla_1: 바닐라가 다리를 노리는 건 꼭 적의 목숨을 살려주기 위해서는 아닙니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Vanilla_2: 다리를 쏘는 이유는 이제 아시리라 믿습니다. 바닐라는 이 공격 연계를 위해 AK에 유탄발사기를 다는 독자적인 개조를 수행했죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Vanilla_3: 뛰어난 메이드는 뒷처리를 중요하게 여깁니다. 주인님의 흔적이라면 치울 때도 힘이 날 텐데요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Rhea_1: 비와 번개가 언제나 생산을 의미하진 않습니다. 레아의 뇌우는 가끔씩 광범위한 파괴를 의미하기도 하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Rhea_2: 얼려진 무언가를 파괴하는데 가장 좋은 것은 바로 급작스러운 열을 가하는 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Rhea_3: 레아는 언제나 평온하고 느긋합니다. 어떠한 경우에도 말이죠...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Rhea_4: 소풍 가고 싶은 날엔 그녀에게 부탁해보세요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Rhea_5: 늘 손해를 보는 성격의 레아를 생존하게 해주는 무언가는 그 불가사의한 행운입니다. 마치 마법처럼 그녀는 불운을 피하고 행운을 움켜쥡니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_ScissorsLise_1: 가지를 치는 것과 다르지도 않네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_ScissorsLise_2: 죽어... 죽어... 죽어. 죽어... 죽어...... 죽어!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_ScissorsLise_3: 히히히... 이 해충... 당신만 죽으면... 주인님이 기뻐할 거야... 당연하지.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Daphne_1: 정원을 가꾸는 데는 마이크로봇이 최고입니다. 삼안 산업과 삼안 정밀의 환상의 콜라보!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Daphne_2: 모든 날개 요정을 적의 몸 구석구석까지 보내 적을 파괴합니다. 아, 시간은 좀 걸릴 것 같군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Daphne_3: 다프네는 식물을 구분하고 작은 해충도 놓치지 않기 위한 아주 민감한 눈을 가지고
  있습니다. 물론, 상냥한 그녀는 그 눈으로 본 것을 동료와 공유할 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Titania_1: 여왕만 아픈건, 불공평하잖아. 안 그래…? 후후…
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Titania_2: 티타니아는 불안정한 성능을 레아에 대한 피해의식과 호르몬 제어 약물을 주입해 보완한 후 출시되었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Titania_3: 레아에 대한 피해의식이야말로 티타니아의 분노와 증오의 근원입니다. 불행히도 그 분노와 증오가 이제 당신에게 향하고 말았지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Titania_4: 티타니아의 근처에 있으면 얼어붙는 듯한 기분을 느낄겁니다. 정신과 신체 양쪽 전부.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Titania_5: 마음 깊은 곳에서는 어떨지 모르겠지만, 티타니아는 겉으로는 죽음이야말로 고통의 끝이라고
  생각합니다. 작은  상처 따위는 무시하고 적들에게 여왕의 분노를 퍼붓죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alexandra_1: 거기! 벌점 1점...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alexandra_2: 어째서 벌점에 행복해 하는 거죠? 좀 더 따끔한 벌이 필요하겠군요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alexandra_4: 약간의 정전기는 집중을 하는데 큰 도움을 주죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alexandra_5: 훌륭한 교사는 당근과 채찍을 동시에 씁니다. 알렉산드라는 확실히 채찍 쪽을 선호하지만.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Alexandra_F4: 하아... 제가 따끔한 것도 좋은데요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Sowan_1: 요리 재료가 아닌 것에 이 기술을 쓴다는 건 안타까운 일이옵니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Sowan_2: 후후, 제 칼은 모든 곳에 있사옵니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Sowan_3: 극상의 맛의 쾌락에 떠는 그 표정은 언제나 절 흥분시키옵니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Sowan_4: 압도적으로 쓸모 없는 것들. 여기 모이십시오!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Sowan_5: 죽은 재료 또는 죽어가는 재료를 빠르게 처리해야 맛을 지킬 수 있는 것이옵니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Annie_1: 멈춰서 쏘는 것이 더 확실하겠지만, 절대로 포기할 수 없는 것도 있는 법입니다. 특히 보안관에게는요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Annie_2: 넌 강해졌어, 돌격해!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Annie_3: "[EUROBEAT INTENSIFIES]"
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Annie_4: 녹음된 엔진소리와 함께 바람처럼 나타나는 아이언 애니는 과거, 범죄자들의 공포의 대상이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Maria_1: 때로는 어른이 직접 나서야 할 때도 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Maria_2: 마리아의 스커트 속은 매우 안전합니다만...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Maria_3: 성실한 마리아는 경호 대상이 필요한 모든 것을 지니고 다닙니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Fotia_1: 본래 요리를 위한 기능이었지만, 현재는 철충을 요리하고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Fotia_2: 안타깝게도 아직 포티아는 미숙하군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackLilith_1: 어차피 전투에는 이상적인 전투 동작이 있어요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackLilith_2: 후후후후후후후후후... 주인님? 설마... 절 떨쳐내시려는 건 아니었죠?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackLilith_3: 하아... 어째서 기분이 좋아지는 걸까요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackLilith_4: 오늘은 하찬은 것들을 괴롭히고 그 비명을 들어볼까요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackLilith_5: 기분이 좋아져요. 적어도 오늘 밤의 경쟁자는 사라졌으니.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_CSPerrault_1: 고양이 손톱은 아닙니다. 냥냥 펀칭이긴 하지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_CSPerrault_2: 페로는 자신이 보호해야 할 대상과 항상 함께 움직입니다. 그게 호위가 더 쉬우니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_CSPerrault_3: 페로의 부드러운 관절은 가동 범위가 넓고 어떤 자세로든 몸을 움직일 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_CSPerrault_4: 상처를 입은 곳을 집중 공격하는 것은 페로에게 남은 가장 강력한 본능입니다. 상처가 많으면 많을 수록 공격이 더 쉬워지는 건 당연하겠죠?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Hachiko_1: 헤헤. 하치는 뻥 터지는 거 좋아요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Hachiko_2: 주인님, 걱정마세요. 친구를 지키고 적은 가까이 오지 못하게 만들면 되는 거죠?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Hachiko_3: 누구든지 제가 지킬 거예요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Hachiko_4: 하치는 쓰러지지 않아요. 주인님이 명령하시기 전까지는요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Fenrir_1: 술래잡기 시~작!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Fenrir_2: 다진 고기도 맛있어!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Fenrir_3: 순찰 보낼 땐 꼭 도시락을 챙겨주셔야 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Fenrir_4: 요즘 밤마다 묘한 울음소리가 들리는 것 같아...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Fenrir_5: 그녀에게 적당히란 없으니 장난칠 때는 주의하세요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Marie_1: 주시자의 눈은 매섭습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Marie_2: 적의 방어선을 뚫는데 필요한 것은 오직 압도적인 화력입니다. 정신력은 그 다음이죠. 많은 사람들이 이걸 착각하더군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Marie_3: 전쟁을 위해서는 굳건한 승리의 의지가 중요합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Marie_4: 레이저 병기가 나온 이상 공군의 기동 회피는 쓸모가 없습니다. 모두 이걸 빨리 깨달았으면 좋겠군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Marie_5: 촘촘한 화망은 적의 진격을 저지하는 가장 좋은 무기입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Efreeti_1: 박격포를 직사로 쏘려면, 포탄을 좀 쎄게 밀어 넣어야 해!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Efreeti_2: 보병 지원을 위한 최고의 선택!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Efreeti_3: 자, 모두 눈 감는 거 잊지 마!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Leprechaun_1: 여유가 있을 때의 레프리콘 전술입니다. 경기관총도 이런 상황에선 명중률이 나쁘지 않죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Leprechaun_2: 브라우니, 뛰어요. 놈들이 머리를 내밀진 못할 테니!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PXSilky_1: 아무리 보급병이라지만 기본적인 무장은 가지고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PXSilky_2: 모두! 보급이 왔어요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PXSilky_3: 보급품 뒤에 숨는다고 벌을 받진 않겠죠?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PXSilky_4: 에? 앞이 안 보인다구요? 하지만, 보급품을 버릴 순 없는 걸요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Phoenix_1: 포격 준비 완료!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Phoenix_2: 도망치는 게 좋을걸? 지친 상태로 죽을 뿐이겠지만.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Phoenix_3: 기다려. 내가 저 자식들을 고개도 내밀지 못하게 만들어 줄 테니.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Phoenix_4: 좀 더 집중을 한다면 적의 약한 부분을 공격할 수 있을 거야.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Gnome_1: 노움이 최전선에서 가장 위협적인 적에게 사격을 퍼붓고 브라우니가 그것을 따라 하는 것만으로도 집중 사격의 효과는 충분합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Gnome_2: 순간적으로 구조를 생성하는 발포 콘크리트는 가볍지만 우수한 강도와 내구성을 지니고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_RedHood_1: 대량 살상무기를 개발해 전쟁을 억제하려던 어떤 시도는 안타깝게도 실패로 끝나고 말았습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_RedHood_2: 이 무기는 전쟁을 억제하는 데는 실패했지만, 마음에 들지 않는 상대를 제압하는데 유용하게 쓰입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_RedHood_3: 레드후드는 자신의 희생을 전술적으로 활용할 줄 아는 영리한 군인이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_RedHood_4: '"하나가 죽어서 우리가 전진할 수 있다면 응당 그래야지!" "저... 제 얼굴에 뭐 묻었슴까?"'
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Habetrot_1: 방아쇠는 당겨졌습니다. 총알이 어디에 명중할지는 하늘의 뜻에 맡겨야겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Habetrot_2: |-
  정보통신이 주특기인 하베트롯은 전자전의 중요성을 잘 알고 있습니다.
  유리섬유 쪼가리가 동료들을 살릴 중요한 생명선이라는 것도요. 
  전차를 보급받은 날, 밤을 새워 개조할 때도 채프 투사기를 제일 먼저 설치했었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Habetrot_3: |-
  스틸라인의 장교라면 어떻게 해야 하는지 주변에 많은 선례들이 있죠.
  아직은 미숙하지만, 책임감만큼은 누구에게도 뒤지지 않습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Leona_1: 일일이 말로 할 필욘 없겠지? 내가 쏘는 걸 따라 쏘면 돼. 이게 쉽고 간편한 지휘지.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Leona_2: 자, 커맨드 프레임에 집중해. 내가 명령하는 순서대로 움직이면 당연히 이길 수 있을 거야.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Leona_3: 모두 명령 들을 준비는 됐어?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Leona_4: 자, 말 안해도 알지? 알아서 버티는 거야.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Leona_5: 내 천재적인 두뇌라면... 앞으로의 일을 예측하는 건 쉬운 일이야. 응? 신기하다고?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Leona_F3: 모두 대열을 지켜. 적의 공격을 분산시키는 거야.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Leona_F4: 모두 돌격할 준비. 겁낼 건 없어. 내가 지휘할 테니까.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Bheur_1: 그녀는 조금이라도 위협이 될 법한 대상을 절대 놓치지 않습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Bheur_2: 사령관이 지난 여름에 한 일을 알고 있을지도......
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Bheur_3: 약간의 생채기만 생겨도 그녀의 관심을 듬뿍 받을 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Alvis_1: 언니들한테 가려면 알비스를 먼저 상대해야 해!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Alvis_2: 몰래 군것질하는 것을 들켰을 때 쓰지만, 가장 깐깐한 언니에게는 안 통합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Alvis_3: 통행료로 초콜릿을 지불하면 지나갈 수 있을지도...?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Kheshig_1: |-
  아직은 전투가 미숙한 케시크여도 지근거리에서 산탄총을 발사하면 적들도 피하지 못하겠죠.
  반격해오면요? 아군들, 특히 호드 부대원들이 곁에 있으니 괜찮습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Kheshig_2: 전술적으로 인원 배치가 가능하다는 시점에서 일반 의무병으로 남기엔 아까운 재능입니다만, 아무래도 그녀는 자신의 특별함을 깨닫지 못한 듯하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Kheshig_3: |-
  제발 무사히만 돌아와 주세요.
  케시크가 부상병들에게 붕대를 감으며 건네는 수많은 말들 중 하나입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Kheshig_4: |-
  동경하는 존재와 같이 전장에 나선다는 건 엄청난 고양감을 불러 일으킵니다.
  하물며 그게 미래의 자신이라면, 자신이 목표하는 경지의 존재라면 더더욱이요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Kheshig_5: |-
  돌아올 수 없다는 걸 알면서 전장으로 떠나는 동료들을, 케시크는 말리지 못 했습니다.
  대신에 자신의 산탄총을 들고서 그들과 함께 전장으로 나설 뿐이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_WarWolf_1: 하나, 둘, 셋, 빵! 빵! 아, 미안. 총이 두 자루였네?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_WarWolf_2: 리볼버의 결합부 구조로는 총검 돌격 시에 큰 충격을 이겨낼 수 없습니다. 그게 워울프가 멋을 포기한 이유죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_TalonFeather_1: 빗나간다면 명중할 때까지 쏘면 됩니다. 귀는 조금 아프겠네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_TalonFeather_2: 재머는 그녀가 들고다니는 패널에 연결되어 있습니다. 그래서 가끔씩 방해전파 대신 다른 것이 송출되기도 하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_TalonFeather_3: 적을 유린하는 호드 부대원들의 모습을 렌즈에 담는 것은 그녀의 은밀한 취미 중 하나입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_TalonFeather_4: 고고도 정찰을 위한 추가적인 개조에는 체지방량 증가도 포함되어 있었습니다. 큰 효과는 없었던 것 같지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Frigga_1: 곰의 유전자를 받은 프리가는 맨손으로도 적을 찢어버릴 수 있지만, 그녀의 쉴드 블레이드는 더 확실하게 처치할 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Frigga_2: 최전선에서 내지르는 포효는 적을 위협하는 것도 있지만, 아군의 사기를 북돋기 위한 의미가
  더 큽니다.​ 용기를 얻은 아군은 꿋꿋하게 전선을 밀고 나아갈 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Frigga_3: 프리가는 모든 사람을 포옹하려 합니다만, 가끔은 행복에 사로잡힌 나머지 힘 조절이 안 될
  때도 있습니다.​ 버티는 것도 좋지만, 많이 아프시다면 로프라도 잡아보는 게 어떨까요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Frigga_4: 모성은 강철보다 단단하며, 모성에 찬 어미곰은 모든 위협에도 굴복하지 않고 전진합니다.​
  그녀를 막을 수 있는 것은 총칼이 아니라, 오직 새끼 곰의 애교뿐입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Frigga_5: 프리가가 적절한 위치를 점하고 경호하는 것만으로도 습격자는 위축될 수밖에 없습니다.
  언제든 거병이 자기에게 휘둘러질 것이라는 것을 본능적으로 느끼게 될 테니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Ajax_1: |-
  유럽 들소의 유전자에서 나오는 근력과 순발력은 
  아이아스의 전투 방식에 큰 기반이 됐습니다.
  성인 남성도 들기 힘든 방패를 한 손에 들 수 있을 뿐더러, 
  순식간에 돌진해서 적들을 쓰러뜨리는데 도움이 됐죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Ajax_2: |-
  가디언 시리즈에 소속된 전문 경호원답게 
  아이아스는 누군가를 지키는 일이 전문입니다.
  뿐만 아니라, 상황을 봐서 적을 쓰러뜨려 위험 근원을 제거하기도 하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Ajax_3: |-
  프리가와 함께 있을 땐 금방이라도 공격할 자세를 갖추는 아이아스지만,
  언니가 없으면 자신이 경호를 담당해야 한단 걸 알고 있습니다.
  프리가의 빈자리를 메울 수 있는 건 오랫동안 그녀의 뒤를 쫓아온
  자신밖에 없으니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Ajax_4: |-
  책임감이 강한 아이아스는 어떤 일이 생겨도
  주어진 시간 안에 자신의 업무를 끝냅니다.
  당신의 일정 또한 계획대로 진행될 수 있게 그녀가 곁에서 도울 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Ajax_5: |-
  회사의 회계와 일정을 관리했던 아이아스에게 
  상호 간에 효율적인 협력 관계를 구축하는 건 일도 아닙니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_May_1: 멸망의 메이는 군도에 배치된 무기고의 무인 폭격기를 호출할 권한을 지니고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_May_2: 드디어 이 버튼을 누를 권한을 받았네?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_May_3: 모두 편대 진형은 숙지했겠지? 거기! 먼저 날아가려고 하지 말라고!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_May_4: 불꽃... 연기... 너무 좋아.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_May_5: 메이가 앉은 심판의 옥좌에는 수많은 위협 물질들이 들어 있습니다. 이게 바로 메이에게 호위기가 필요한 이유죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_NightAngel_1: 모든 장갑에는 천적이 필요합니다. 대부분의 경우 그건 미사일이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_NightAngel_2: Kill MP. Kill MP. Kill more MP!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_NightAngel_3: 이 머리핀 형태의 초소형 드론은 밤천사의 또 다른 눈이 되어 줍니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_NightAngel_4: 질투. 가진 자를 향해 가지지 못한 자가 품는 마음.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sylphid_1: 난사는 적을 정확히 맞추는 것보다 견제로 적의 움직임을 봉쇄하는 것에 의의를 둬야 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sylphid_2: 철충이 특정 파장의 적외선을 뿜어내는 것은 상당히 유명합니다. 약간만 개조하면 본래의 공대공 미사일도 충분히 쓸 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sylphid_3: 나 완전 초멋진 거 아냐?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Banshee_1: 낮은 생환율을 뚫고 몇 번의 폭격 임무에서 살아남은 밴시들은 항공 폭탄 투하 후에
  기관포를 이용해 추가적인 타격을 입히는 활약을 펼치기도 했습니다. 그마저도 오래가진 못했지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Banshee_2: 밴시가 급강하 할때 들리는 소름끼치는 소리는 적들에겐 공포의 대항이었습니다. 역사속으로
  사라졌던 기체와 다른 점은, 밴시의 목표물에겐 듣고 대비할 시간이 거의 없다는 점이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Banshee_3: 밴시는 뛰어난 비행술과 기관포를 이용해 제한적으로나마 공대공 전투를 수행할 수
  있습니다만, 불필요한 희생을 줄이기 위해선 역시 호위기를 대동해야 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_StratoAngel_1: 압도적인 미사일의 수에는 그 어떤 장갑도 소용없죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_StratoAngel_2: If you can read this, you're already dead. /
  하늘에 떠있는 그녀를 발견했다면, 당신은 이미 죽은 것과 다름없습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_StratoAngel_3: 폭격기는 어떻게 사용하는가에 따라 전투를 지원할 수도, 전투를 끝낼 수도 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_StratoAngel_4: 우월감. 가진 자만이 누릴 수 있는 마음.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_RoyalArsenal_1: 반물질탄을 사용하지는 않습니다. 아쉽네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_RoyalArsenal_2: 핵포탄을 탑재하려는 계획은 백지화되었습니다. 대신 그녀의 무기고엔 그 외에 거의 모든 탄종이 탑재되었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_RoyalArsenal_3: 로열 아스널은 느리고 강력한 화력을 가진 부대원들을 지휘하는 방법을 아주 잘 알고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_RoyalArsenal_4: 통제보급률? 하. 쓸데없는 걱정을 하는 군. 그런 소리를 할 시간에 한 발이라도 더 퍼부어라.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_RoyalArsenal_5: 그녀의 전술 조준경에 탑재된 시스템은 캐노니어 부대원들의 포격을 관제하는 것에 특화 되어있지만, 다른 전투원들을 지휘하는 것도 가능합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BloodyPanther_1: 블러디 팬서의 주포는 중요한 순간을 위해 아껴둡니다. 보병같이 장갑이 약한 적은 이것으로 충분하겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BloodyPanther_2: 과거, 아시아에서 사용하던 256 활강포를 개조한 것입니다. 유효 사거리 3.5km.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BloodyPanther_3: 블러디 팬서의 작압은 방어력 뿐 아니라 무게로도 도움을 줍니다. 자기의 반동을 이기려면 충분한 무게가 있어야겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BloodyPanther_4: 고온 상황, 저온 상황, 방사능에 의한 위험 상황, 생물학적 위험 상황,
  화학적 위험 상황, 모두 우수항 성적으로 통과했습니다. 다행히 사령관에 의한 위험 상황은 시험하지 않았군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BloodyPanther_5: 고대 중국에서는 이 전술을 팔진도라고 불렀습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BloodyPanther_F1: 높은 안정감, 낮은 반동.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BloodyPanther_F2: 자자, 다시 움직여 볼까?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Calista_1: 내부가 리볼버 구조로 되어 있는 주포는 좀 더 빠른 연사를 보장합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Calista_2: 복합 장갑이 존재하지 않는 철충에게 특히 효과적입니다. 물론, 실제로 탄두가 액체가 되진 않아요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Calista_3: 리볼버에는 클립 리로더가 최고죠! 단 한 번에 재포격 준비 완료!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Calista_4: 누가 누굴 보호한다는 거야? 내가 질 것 같아?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Io_1: 으아아아아앙!!! 죽으세요!!!!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Io_2: 모든 탄을 한 번에 날리는 것은 로망 중 하나입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Io_3: 어떤 바이오로이드에게는 안전하다는 인식이 가장 큰 무기가 될 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Spriggan_1: 칼과 방패는 계속해서 진화해 왔어. 그래서, 결국 누가 이겼게?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Spriggan_2: 내 커다란 친구에게 인사하시지!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Spriggan_3: 진짜, 진짜 너희들만 알고 있어야 돼.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BeastHunter_1: 철갑을 뚫고 내부에 초고온의 제트를 뿜어내는 고폭탄은 포병의 가장 기본적인 무기입니다. 아쉬운 건 유산탄 때문에 강선포를 쓰는 것 하나군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BeastHunter_2: 흑색 화약 시절부터 존재하던 무기지만 2차원을 파괴하는 데는 이것만 한 게 없죠. 사정거리가 긴 산탄은 언제나 유용합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BeastHunter_3: 비스트헌터는 하나의 적이 쓰러지는 것으론 만족을 느끼지 못하는 몸입니다. 그녀는 적을 죽인 후, 더욱 큰 욕망에 사로잡힙니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_BeastHunter_4: 방심하면 안 됩니다. 적을 쓰러뜨린 후에는 바로 포격을 퍼부어 잔당을 섬멸해야 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Emily_1: 동력 소모가 많긴 하지만... 총알은 빨라...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Emily_2: 아주 특수한 액체 탄환을 플라즈마 상태가 될 때까지 열과 압력을 가해서 만듭니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Emily_3: 충전에는 시간이 필요하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Emily_4: 레일건은 전력을 지원해 주는 게 제일 좋습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Emily_5: 나... 너... 용서 못해.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Emily_F2: 너! 가 버려! 아! 가 버려요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Pani_1: 달라붙어 폭발해 내부를 좀 더 효과적으로 파괴합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Pani_2: 탄두를 텅스텐 합금으로 만든 철갑탄입니다. 포신의 수명을 낮추는 문제를 가지고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Pani_3: 파니의 진짜 힘은 집단전에서 나옵니다. 군집 성향이 있는 파니는 좀 더 효율적이게 전열을 짤 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Raven_1: 장갑 틈새를 노려서 쏘면 돼. 사령관도 쏴 볼래?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Raven_2: 평소에는 소문을 좋아하는 어느 자매와 함께 다니니 주의해야 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Raven_3: 51SYB 62711 66673 지점에 몇 방 부탁해!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Neodym_1: 내 몸으로 자력을 일으키는 건 이상하게 생각하지 말았으면 좋겠어. 자력은 전력으로 만들 수 있고... 전기 뱀장어도 전력을 만들어 내잖아...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Neodym_2: 모두 움직이지 마... 다칠 수도 있으니까...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Neodym_3: 무서워... 나... 숨고 싶어...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Neodym_4: 특정 모양으로 전기가 흐르는 철은 자석이 됩니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Neodym_5: 강철이 날 지켜줄 거야.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Phantom_1: 보이지 않는 칼날.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Phantom_2: 내부를 향해 폭발합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Phantom_3: 빛이 직진한다는 것은 편견입니다. 약간의 조작으로도 빛은 쉽게 휘어 버리죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Phantom_4: 보이지 않는 적은 언제나 두렵습니다. 하지만, 총알은 눈이 없고, 보이지 않는 적을 두려워하지 않죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Echidna_1: 네 부츠에... 뱀이 들어있구나.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Echidna_2: 딱히... 너희들을 도우려는 건 아니었다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Echidna_3: 아무 걱정 마라... 튕겨냈으니.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Echidna_4: 어딜 보고 있지? 저건 내 부하일 뿐이다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Echidna_5: 1. 소지품 다 버리기 2. 수평으로 움직이기 3. 뒤로 눕기 4. 충분히 시간을 가지기 5. 기도하기
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_DrM_1: 이론 상 강도와 실제 강도의 오차를 시험해 볼까?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_DrM_2: 일단 샘플링을 해야겠지?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_DrM_3: 에... 아직 테스트가 덜 끝난 거지만... 없는 것보단 나을 거야?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_DrM_4: 자, 티탄아! 힘내 볼까?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_DrM_5: 두뇌가동 300%
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Amy_1: 방사성 물질로 된 총알은 여러 가지 의미로 위험합니다. 특히, 항상 감지될 수 있는 표식을 남겼다는 데서 가장 위험하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Amy_2: 방사선을 감지하는 스코프는 절대로 적을 혼동하지 않게 만들어줍니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Amy_3: 자신의 임무를 수행했다는 것은 에이미에게 격렬한 흥분과 만족을 동시에 줍니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Tomoe_1: 권총은 화력이 부족하고, 소총은 가방에 들어가지 않습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Tomoe_2: 파이어 인 더 올! 너희 모두 이 세상에서 해고야!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Shirayuri_1: 시라유리는 이 화살을 이용해 적대 시설의 시설물을 핀 포인트로 무력화 시키곤 했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Shirayuri_2: 이 화살로 변하는 액체 금속 리본에 비하면, 독침이 달린 부츠는 어린애 장난처럼 보일 뿐이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Shirayuri_3: 대부분의 고위층 자제들은 시라유리에게 정보를 누설하고 있다는 사실을 전혀 인지하지 못했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Shirayuri_4: 당신이 협력을 요청한다면, 시라유리는 자신의 비밀 노트(가짜)를 기꺼이 펼쳐 보일 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Shirayuri_5: 절대... 시라유리에게 책 잡히지 말 것. - 불가사리
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_HongRyun_1: Freeze!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_HongRyun_2: 홍련을 무서워하는 몽구스 팀원들이지만, 연산 모듈을 이용한 그녀의 전장 분석과 전황 예측은 신뢰하고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_HongRyun_3: 몽구스 팀. 핀토가 적들을 교란하는 동안 현장으로 급습합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_HongRyun_4: 드라코는 진입 준비를. 불가사리, 길을 열어 주세요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_HongRyun_5: 미호! 3층 창문에 저격수!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_AS12TurtleDragon_1: 빵빵! 전부 고개 숙여!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_AS12TurtleDragon_2: 뒤로 오면 내가 지켜줄게!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_AS12TurtleDragon_3: 적의 공격은 맞받는 게 아니라 흘리는 거야!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Miho_1: 다른 곳에 눈을 돌리고 있는 적을 저격하는 건 쉬운 일이죠. 더 큰 피해를 줄 수도 있고요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Miho_2: 미호는 타겟을 마무리하는 탁월한 능력을 가지고 있습니다. 상처입은 적을 어떻게 공격해야 효과적일 지를 잘 알고있죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Miho_3: 미호는 본능적으로 전열의 방어 유닛이 공격하는 적을 따라 공격합니다. 그런 행동들은 미호가
  좀 더 눈에 눈에 덜 띄고 좀 더 안전하게 적을 공격하는데 도움을 줍니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PoniesAnger_1: 여기야! 여기!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PoniesAnger_2: 핀토의 변화 무쌍한 비행은 아주 특수한 프롭 엔진에서 나옵니다. 핀토는 다리를 움직이는 것만으로 손쉽게 비행 방향을 바꿀 수 있죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PoniesAnger_3: 자, 내 뒤만 따라오라고!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_InvDragon_1: 그녀의 세자루 검은 각각 호라이즌, 포세이돈, 머메이든의 지휘권을 상징합니다. 물론, 앞을 가로막는 적들을 베어버릴 수도 있죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_InvDragon_2: 무적의 용의 지휘를 받아 사기가 하늘을 찌를 듯한 대원들이 독려까지 받는다면 신병조차도 역전의 용사처럼 싸울 수 있죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_InvDragon_3: 아군의 피해를 최소화하는 그녀의 방식은 병사들의 신뢰를 이끌어냈습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_InvDragon_4: 무적의 용이 무적이라고 불리는 이유입니다. 군대를 지휘하고 전쟁을 승리로 이끄는 것에 한해선 그녀를 따를 자는 없었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_InvDragon_5: 무적의 용의 주 무대였던 바다에선 적을 먼저 발견하는 것이 무엇보다 중요합니다.
  그러지 못한다면, 어디에서 날아오는 것인지 모를 포탄과 미사일에 유린당할 뿐이니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_InvDragon_F1: 무적의 용이 이끄는 함대의 일제 포격입니다. 목표지점을 단숨에 평탄화시킬 정도로
  강력하죠. 다만, 포격 신호를 전달하는 순간 함대의 위치가 발각되기 때문에 지속적인 지원을 기대하기는 어렵습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_InvDragon_F2: 칼을 뽑았으면 무라도 베어야 한다구요? 물러설 때도 알아야 하는 법입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Undine_1: 아무래도 배를 가라앉히기엔 기관총은 위력이 약하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Undine_2: 수면을 가르며 날아갑니다. 마치 날치처럼요. 방공구축함과 호위함의 천적.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Undine_3: 자! 모두 같은 방향으로 도는 거야!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Undine_4: 역사적으로도 내 우월성은 증명되어 있어. 모두 인정하지?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sirene_1: 걱정 마세요. 근방에 가기만 해도 폭발하니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sirene_2: 중순양함에 배치된 세이렌의 속사는 수많은 적들을 절망에 빠뜨렸습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sirene_3: 에이밍에 걸리는 시간, 단 0.1초
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sirene_4: 어떤 적도 이 화망을 뚫어낼 수는 없습니다. 이건 그냥 사냥이에요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sirene_5: 자, 각도를 불러주세요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sirene_F1: 거함 거포, 함대전의 로망이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sirene_F2: 8인치 포의 속사는 쉽게 되는 것이 아닙니다. 향상된 장전 시스템 덕분이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sirene_F4: 가랏! 8인치 포!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Thetis_1: 단축형 경기관총이지만 테티스에겐 상당히 무겁습니다. 양 손으로 들면 될 걸 허세 때문에 낑낑대며 한 손으로 사격하는 건 그냥 귀엽게 봐주세요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Thetis_2: 운디네에 비하면 허약한 화력입니다만, 본인은 죽었다 깨어나도 인정하지 않을 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Thetis_3: 운디네와 혼자만의 신경전을 펼친 뒤 테티스는 임무에 집중합니다. 네리에게 질 수는 없으니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Thetis_4: 이것 저것 많이 싣는다고 강해지는게 아니라고 조언해주려던 세이렌은 너무 행복해보이는 테티스의 모습을 보고 포기했습니다. 정말 사려깊네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sleipnir_1: 레이저 무기는 슬레이프니르를 통해 그 잠재력을 보여줬지만 안타깝게도 완전히 실용화가 될 시간을 얻지는 못했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sleipnir_2: 슬레이프니르의 가장 큰 무기는 말도 안되는 비행 속도입니다. 슬레이프니르는 속도를
  자유자재로 조종해 충격파를 만들어 공명 현상을 일으킵니다. 다른 비행체는 상상도 하지 못할 재주죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sleipnir_3: 흥! 날 맞출 수 있는 총알이 있을 리 없잖아?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sleipnir_4: 회피 동작을 자연스럽게 공격 동작으로 연결하는 거야. 뭐, 나한텐 쉬워보이지.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Sleipnir_5: 내 날개를 묶을 수 있을 거라고 생각한 거야?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PA00EL_1: TV 유도 방식입니다. 아예 조종을 해주는 게 가장 확실하죠. 물론 숙련된 그리폰이라면 고글 화면의 조종창 따위는 확인하지 않지만.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PA00EL_2: 비인도적인 무기일 수록 철충에겐 효과적입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_PA00EL_3: 추격과 공격 이전의 전술 지침.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Harpy_1: Fox Three, Fox Three!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Harpy_2: 되는대로 퍼붓는 것 같지만 사실 이미 계산이 전부 끝나있습니다. 공격하는 동안 그녀는
  저번에 읽었던 책의 결말에 대해 생각하고 있을지도 모르겠네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Harpy_3: 그녀의 개발기간 중 대부분이 스텔스 성능과 특정부위의 부피 간의 상관관계에 대한 갑론을박으로 소모되었다는 루머가 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Harpy_4: 그녀는 전장의 모든 정보를 취합, 분석해 편대원들과 공유합니다. 그 놀라운 연산능력과 끝도 없는 지식량에 편대원들은 감탄하기도, 졸기도 하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Harpy_5: 차세대 발사 시스템은 무장발사 시 스텔스 기능을 유지함은 물론, 공대지 공격도 가능하게 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Blackhound_1: 역시 공중전에선 기총이죠?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Blackhound_2: 철충이 가진 전자기파에 대한 방호력도 완전하지는 않습니다. 전자 신경계를
  잠깐이라도 교란할 수 있다면 전투에 큰 이득을 얻을 수 있을 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Blackhound_3: 안심하고 전투 준비를 갖추세요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Blackhound_4: 비프는 공중전 최고의 기술이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Lindwurm_1: 바이오로이드가 좋은 점은 기관포를 쏠 때 방해되는 게 없다는 거죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Lindwurm_2: 공대공에서 사용하기 위해 만들어진 이 미사일은 곧 지상 목표물 공격에 압도적인 성능을 가진다는 것이 알려졌습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Lindwurm_3: 내 귀여움 앞에선 누구든지 넋을 놓을 수 밖엔 없을걸? 그 때를 노리는 거야!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_TaylorClothcut_1: |-
  귀엽게 별 모양으로 잘라볼까?
  윽. 그래도 징그러운 건 여전하네.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_TaylorClothcut_2: 시스터! 새 옷이야! 이얏!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_TaylorClothcut_3: 생존도 천박한 농담이 된 시대지만 그래도 아름다움은 변하지 않지.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_TaylorClothcut_4: |-
  일 더하기 일? 더 많은 일이지.
  하하하, 농담이야, 농담.
  응? 표정이 왜 그래, 오드리?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_TaylorClothcut_5: |-
  나도 모델을 해보고 싶었지만 키가 작아서 안 되더라고.
  그래도 런던, 밀라노, 파리, 뉴욕 그리고 그 외에도 많은 나라에서 내 옷을 선보였지.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiEnrai_1: 엔라이의 부러진 일본도 끝에서 이글대는 불꽃의 칼날이 생겨나는 순간, 그녀의 적들은 목숨을 잃을 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiEnrai_2: |-
  무라사키 가문에는 항상 두 딸이 태어나고, 각각 화염과 번개를 다루는 힘을 가집니다.
  이름은 다루는 속성에 따라 라이덴과 카엔으로 붙여지지요.
  둘 중 더 뛰어난 쿠노이치가 엔라이라는 이름을 받고, 다른 이는 모든 것을 잃게 됩니다. 힘과 지위, 그리고…목숨까지도.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiEnrai_3: |-
  닌자에게 가장 중요한 것은 은밀함입니다.
  나막신을 신고 눈 위를 걷는다고 해도 발자국을 남기지 않을 만큼,
  체중계의 눈금마저 속일 수 있을 만큼 몸놀림이 가벼워야 하지요.
  네, 체중계의 눈금마저 속일 수 있을 만큼 말입니다…
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiEnrai_4: |-
  엔라이는 하츠나와 스미레를 아주 아낀답니다.
  하지만, 육아 경험이 없기에, 가끔 의도치 않게 딸들에게 너무 엄격한 모습을 보이곤 하지요. 그럴 때 그녀는 어쩔 줄을 모르고,
  시무룩한 표정으로 당신의 방 문을 두드린답니다…
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiEnrai_5: |-
  엔라이는 '무라사키류'의 당주답게, 완벽한 무라사키류 검술을 구사합니다. 그리고 그 사실에 자부심을 가지고 있지요.
  오르카호에서 카엔과 제로가 구사하는 무라사키류를 보자 버럭 화를 낼 정도로 말입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_CoCoWhiteShell_1: 같은 곳을 계속 치는 것은 그 곳의 피로도를 누적시키죠. 리버 블로우가 그 것을 증명합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_CoCoWhiteShell_2: 전기 소모가 심하긴 하지만, 확실히 안전합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_CoCoWhiteShell_3: 임시로 참호로 쓰기 좋습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_CoCoWhiteShell_4: 세라믹은 완벽한 물질입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Spartoia_1: 스파토이아는 우주 미아 제조기라는 별명을 가지고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Spartoia_2: THIS! IS! MARS!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Spartoia_3: 여기는 스파토이아! 휴스턴!? 오늘은 인공위성 발사 예정이...!! 응? 거기 휴스턴 아니에요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Spartoia_4: 스파토이아는 유인 위성에 들러붙은 뒤, 단단해지기를 시전했다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Audrey_1: 철충이 이 판타스틱한 아름다움을 이애할지는 모르겠지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Audrey_2: 엑설런트! 우린 어디서든 아름다움을 추구하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Audrey_3: 영감은 현장에서 더 잘 떠오르는 법이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Audrey_4: 좋은 소재를 발견했네요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Audrey_5: 눈 깜짝할 사이에 수선해드리죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_TommyWalker_1: 펙스 콘소시엄의 신기술을 누리십시오! 폭약으로 굴착을 하는 건 시대에 뒤떨어진 행위죠!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_TommyWalker_2: 원래는 수송 수단입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_TommyWalker_3: 토미 워커와 드론은 본래 함께 작업반을 이루기 위해 만들어졌습니다. 당연히 함께 구매할 경우, 15%의 할인 혜택이 함께 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Triaina_1: 자, 이제 게임을 시작할까?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Triaina_2: 모든 유체에 소용돌이를 일으키는 이 장치는 가벼운 물질 안에서도 충분한 위력을 낼 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Triaina_3: 그럼 넌 동료야!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Triaina_4: 바다에서 일어나는 어떤 조난에서도 가장 위험한 건 저체온증입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Cerberus_1: 과잉 진압이 아니에요. 힘은 필요한 만큼만... 이 기절은 전기 쇼크 때문에 그런 거라구요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Cerberus_2: 고분자 공학의 결정체. 시민의 안전만을 생각하는 카라카스 산업의 기술력을 확인하세요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Cerberus_3: 켈베로스는 자신의 한계까지 시민을 보호합니다. 시민이 없는 지금은 당연히 뒤쪽의 동료를 보호하기 위해 몸을 던지겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Rampart_1: 시민의 안전을 지키는 최고의 방법은 적이 머리를 내밀 수 없을 정도로 총알을 퍼부어 주는 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Rampart_2: 걱정 마십시오. 시민 여러분. 제 방패 뒤에서 안전을 누리십시오.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_PuppHead_1: 이름! 이름! 말씀을 하십시오! 어째서 거품만 물고 대답을 하지 않는 겁니까!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_PuppHead_2: 거기! 범죄자! 체포하겠다!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Express76_1: 배달물 던질 게. 좀 무거워도 괜찮지?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Express76_2: 택배를 받았을 때의 기분을 완벽하게 재현합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Express76_3: 고객님들의 미소가 가장 큰 선물이야.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Express76_4: 택배 받기 전 기분... 모두 기억나지?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Fortune_1: 걱정 마. 공장에 쳐들어오는 나쁜 놈들은 못총 맛을 보게 될 거거든?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Fortune_2: 토순이 귀엽거든?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Fortune_3: 포츈은 자동화 공장의 로봇 설비들에 대한 완벽한 지식을 가지고 있습니다. 물론, 이 지식은 모든 로봇에게 적용이 되는 지식입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_LRL_1: 큭. 큭. 큭. 평범한 필멸자여. 이 붉은 색이 용의 피로 물든 것을 네가 알아볼 수 있을까?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_LRL_2: "Long Range Light : 선택적 등대 폐쇄가 가능한 최고의 선택!"
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_MightyR_1: 앞으로 쏠린 무게 중심과 속이 꽉 찬 단단함. 바벨은 가장 완벽한 둔기입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_MightyR_2: 단거리 달리기는 유연하고 강한 다리 근육을 만드는데 효과적입니다. 스프린트에 비하면 스쿼트는 너무 밸런스가 나쁜 운동이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_MightyR_3: 무호흡 운동으로 심장을 자극하세요! 살아 숨쉬는 근육이 느껴지실 거예요! 자! 앞으로 하나만 더!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_MightyR_4: 마이티R은 훌륭한 보디빌더이자 훌륭한 트레이너입니다. 그녀를 따라하면 멋진 몸매,
  건강한 몸, 훌륭한 근육을 얻을 수 있지요. 그 과정은 지옥같이 고통스럽겠지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_MightyR_5: 아름다움은 곧 힘! 마이티R의 극한에 다다른 육체미는 곧 극한의 힘으로 이어집니다. 아군에게는 아름다움을, 적에게는 파괴를!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Tiequan_1: 티에치엔은 기를 날려보내는 거라고 주장합니다. 아무리 봐도 유탄을 발로 쳐서 차
  날리는거지만... 그래도 위력 만큼은 농담이 아닙니다. 참고로 손가락 지가 아닌 팔다리 지라고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Tiequan_2: 네네. 영거리 유탄발사가 아니라 정권으로 기를 내뿜는 거겠죠. 아무렴요. 누가 뭐랬나요? ......어? 불발...탄?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Tiequan_3: 쇠는 두드릴 수록 단단해집니다. 티에치엔은 경험을 쌓을 수록 강해지지요. 그리고
  충분히 단단해진 쇠처럼 충분히 강해진 티에치엔은 쉽게 막을 수 없을 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Tiequan_4: 발경을 위해선 상대와의 거리를 조절할 줄 알아야겠죠? 티에치엔에게는 문제없었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Tiequan_5: 넉량으로 천근의 무게를 다스리기 위해선 우선 천근을 다스릴 힘을 얻어야합니다. 티에치엔은 그 이치를 깨달았지요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Johanna_1: 요안나보다 날카롭게 검을 휘두르는 이는 많습니다. 그러나 요안나만큼 집요하게 휘두르는 이는 많지 않습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Johanna_2: 기사도는 시대에 따라 변모되었습니다. 그러나 그 어느 때에도 약자를 존중하고 보호하라는 구절은 빠지지 않았습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Johanna_3: 성전이 선포되었을 때, 요안나는 가장 앞에 서서 적들의 파도를 제일 먼저 받아냈습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Johanna_4: 인간이 모두 사라지고 요안나의 죄를 사해줄 자도, 벌을 내려줄 자도 모두 사라졌습니다. 그러나 그녀는 남아 묵묵히 속죄하고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Johanna_5: 요안나는 자신의 모든 것을 내려놓고, 가장 낮은 곳에서 모든 이를 섬기겠다고 맹세했습니다. 그녀는 모든 이들을 위한 방패가 되었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scathy_1: 그렇게■ ■ 보이지■ 스카디는 뛰어난 해커입니다. 그녀가 해킹을 할 때에는 자신의 몸■
  ■■■ ■■■■ 보이지■ 어디까지나 웨어러블 컴퓨터를 조작■■ ■■■■■ ■■하지 ■■■■요. ......스카디 씨! 아군도 해킹하지
  말아주세요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scathy_2: 실행 가능한 모든 전산적인 해킹이 먹히지 않는다면 스카디는 최후의 방법을 선택합니다.
  아니, 때로는 다른 방법이 있어도 이 방법을 쓰기도 합니다. 아니, 사실... 이 방법을 즐기는 것 같기도 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scathy_3: 스카디가 희생양을...... 적을 찾아냈습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scathy_4: 스카디가 전해주는 해킹 종합 선물 세트입니다. 사양하지 마세요. 사양하지 말라니까요? 사양하지마.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scathy_5: 브루트 포스란 조합 가능한 모든 문자열을 하나씩 대입하여 암호를 해독하는 방법을 말합니다. 하지만 스카디에게는 다른 의미로도 쓰입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Atalanta_1: 투창으로 적의 기세를 꺾고 적의 움직임을 방해하는 전법은 오랫동안 효과적이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Atalanta_2: 오라! 칼리돈의 짐승이여! 네게 아카디아의 영광을 보이노라!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Atalanta_3: 어떤 시련도 영웅 아탈란테의 기세를 꺾을 수는 없습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Atalanta_4: 펠타 방패는 그리스 경보병들의 전통적인 무장입니다. 강력한 금속으로 만들어진 이
  방패는 에너지 필드 개조를 통해 더욱 단단해 졌고, 그녀의 능숙한 방패술은 그녀와 함께하는 아군에게 용기와 영감을 줍니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Charlotte_1: 칼을 뽑으세요! 후대에 부끄럽지 않도록!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Charlotte_2: 좋은 승부였어요. 도전은 언제나 환영입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Charlotte_3: 어떤 곳에서는 카드 게임으로 결투를 한다고 하네요. 어떤 방식인지 궁금하군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Charlotte_4: 자~ 겁내지 말고 당신들도 무대 위로 올라와 보세요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Charlotte_5: 총탄 정도는 우습게 튕겨낼 정도로 결투 중인 그녀의 집중력은 상상을 초월합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Azazel_1: 불신자여, 이제 심판을 받을 지니.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Azazel_2: 당신 천사들에게 명령하시어 네 모든 길에서 너를 지키게 하시리라.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Azazel_3: 그의 빛 안에 살면, 갈 길을 인도하시리.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Azazel_4: 전 살아날 수 있습니다. 여의주는 필요 없어요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Azazel_5: 일어나세요. 용사여.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Baekto_1: 악에게 발언권은 없습니다! 조용히 하세요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Baekto_2: 때와 장소에 상관없이 악과 좋은 대화 수단이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Baekto_3: 악에 타락한 마법소녀라니... 그런 건 절대 있을 수 없어요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Baekto_4: 악에 대항하는 이를 위해, 달은 언제나 그곳에 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Goltarion_1: 빔무기를 눈에 장착하자는 의견도 있었지만, 표정과 감정선을 중요시한 감독의 반대로 인해 반영되지 않았습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Goltarion_2: 정확한 위치에 소품을 투하하는 것이 핵심 연출 기술이었습니다. 다음 세대
  골타리온의 추가 발주 소식은 사고를 친 드론 담당자가 해고된다는 것을 의미했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Goltarion_3: 마왕의 부하는 1회차 만에 사망한다는 법칙을 깨고, 첫 장기 에피소드의 시작을 알린 상징적인 캐릭터입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Goltarion_4: 마계 군단장 골타리온은 뽀끄루 대마왕의 충직한 심복입니다. 그녀가 아무리 설명해도 소용이 없을 정도로요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Arman_1: 논리가 안 통하는 바보에겐 이보다 효율적인 수단은 없죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Arman_2: 하지만, 기적을 일으키는 건 결국 자신의 몫입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Arman_3: 어느 골치 아픈 동료 때문에 사고가 유연해질 수밖에 없었다고 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Arman_4: 좋은 결과를 위해선 좋든 싫든 모든 수단을 동원하는 게 최선입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Arman_5: 적의 패턴을 분석하여 다음 행동을 도출했습니다. 선제공격을 개시하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_BunnySlayer_1: |-
  니바의 비밀무기 겸 비상식량인 '당근 칼리버'로 적을 단죄합니다. 
  맞은 대상은 몹시 화가 나게 됩니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_BunnySlayer_2: 일반적인 바니-살해술로만 싸워도 바니 슬레이어를 막을 자는 존재하지 않습니다만,
  필살기는 언제나 필요하죠. 바니의 혼을 발끝에 집중시켜 적을 꿰뚫어버리는 바니 파멸킥!은 위력으로나 이름으로나 필살기에 적합합니다. 힘을
  개방한 상태가 아닐 경우, 시전 시에 좀 귀여워보인다는 사소한 문제가 있긴 합니다만...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_BunnySlayer_3: |-
  니바는 사실 바니걸 출신입니다. 
  그런 그녀가 어째서 바니걸을 증오하게 되었는지는... 오직 그녀만이 알겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_BunnySlayer_4: 바니걸을 상대로 특효인, 바니 슬레이어만의 잔혹한 무술입니다. 무서움!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_BunnySlayer_5: |-
  니바의 뜨거운 심장에서 뿜어져 나오는 강력한 기운입니다. 
  평소에는 인형옷 형태로 몸에 두르고 있지만, 이 강대한 기운을 몸에 갈무리할 경우 
  니바는 진정한 바니 슬레이어의 힘을 휘두르게 됩니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Carolina_1: 원래 필살기는 가슴에서 나가는 법!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Carolina_2: 마! 아, 이게 아닌가?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Carolina_3: 왼쪽! 오른쪽! 다시~! 왼쪽! 오른쪽!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Carolina_4: 난 응원을 하고 있는 게 아니야. 리듬에 몸을 맡기는 거야.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_BS_1: 크랭크~ 업!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_BS_2: 저기... 비밀 번호가...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_BS_3: 유미가 좀 더 일찍 발매되었다면 도시폰이 대세가 되었을 지도...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_BS_4: 후... 난 도시의 차가운 커리어우먼... 하지만 아군에겐 따뜻하겠지.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_ElvenForestmaker_1: 천일의 물은 만년의 바위를 쪼개는 법!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_ElvenForestmaker_2: 과거의 어떤 나라에는 나무를 심는 특별한 기념일이 있었다고 합니다. 그때의 구호가 푸르게 푸르게였나요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_ElvenForestmaker_3: 부시! 부시! 부시를 조심하세요! 부시 안에 있는 독 버섯도!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Ignis_1: 파이어 잇 업!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Ignis_2: 가장 위험한 분진이 될 수 있도록 수많은 연구가 이루어졌습니다. 알루미늄 가루 따위는 비교도 할 수 없죠!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Ignis_3: 투박하지만 어떠한 환경에서도 안전을 보장합니다!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Ignis_4: 현장에선 전문가를 따라다니는 게 최선의 방법입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_DarkElf_1: 반동 제어? 문제없어. 근데 어디를 보고 있는 거야?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_DarkElf_2: 앗 깜짝이야! 뭐야 이거...?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_DarkElf_3: 예나 지금이나 앞장서는 건 그녀에게 익숙한 일입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Circe_1: 할로윈 축제 시작해요~!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Circe_2: 혼을 빼놓는 퍼포먼스~!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Circe_3: 모든 문제의 원인이지만 해결책이기도 하죠~
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Circe_4: 제 수정 구슬 보신 분~?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Babariana_1: 침입자들의 최종 신원을 파악하는 데 어려움을 겪던 비스마르크사는 바바리아나에게 총을 들려주었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Babariana_2: "철거 개시 : (← 모으고 → + A or C)"
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Babariana_3: 적의 두껍고 튼튼한 장갑은 바바리아나의 도전 욕구를 자극합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Babariana_4: 애송이, 정신 차려!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Veronica_1: 잘못된 믿음은 결코 바로잡아야 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Veronica_2: 믿음 없는 죄인들을 수확하는 일은 언제나 보람찹니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Veronica_3: 고결한 희생을 하는 이들을 돕는 게 제 사명이지요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Veronica_4: 그녀의 의지는 최후의 순간에도 꺼지지 않습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Saraqael_1: 법보다는 주먹이 가깝다는 말이 있죠. 아마 과거 사라카엘이 이끌던 코헤이 교단의 이단심문부대를 두고 하는 말일 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Saraqael_2: "'빛'에 대한 사라카엘의 신앙은 광기에 가깝습니다. 교단의 율법을 어긴 자가 있을
  경우, 사라카엘이 직접 나서서 신성한 번개로 그가 속죄할 수 있도록 돕곤 했습니다."
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Saraqael_3: 아자젤의 것과는 반대로, 사라카엘의 검은 날개는 ‘빛’의 진노와 심판을 상징합니다. 감촉과 질감도 좀 다르다고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Saraqael_4: 사라카엘을 죽이지 못하는 고통은 그녀의 신앙을 더욱 깊어지게 만들 뿐입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Saraqael_5: 교단의 율법 중 가장 중요한 계명 중 하나는 ‘부정한 것을 몸에 대지 말라’ 입니다.
  당연히 사라카엘은 그 말씀을 충실히 따라 어떤 경우에도 축성받은 사제복 외에는 걸치지 않습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Angel_1: 잘못된 길을 걷는 자를 올바른 길로 인도하기 위해서 약간의 교정은 어쩔 수 없었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Angel_2: 정신감응 능력을 지닌 엔젤은 상대방의 감정을 느낄 수 있습니다. 사령관을 따르는 대원들의
  마음도, 오르카 호 가족들을 소중하게 생각하는 구원자님의 마음도요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Angel_3: 세계의 안녕과 평화를 위해서 그녀는 매일 빛께 기도를 올립니다. 최근에는 구원자님의 이름도 종종 언급된다고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Angel_4: 세계를 구원하기 위해 재림한 엔젤의 사명감은 특별합니다. 다치고, 쓰러지더라도 모두를 위해서 다시 한번 일어설 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Draculina_1: 소리는 곧 진동이죠. 웬만한 중장비를 뛰어 넘는 작업 효율 덕분에 드라큐리나는
  무대 뿐만 아니라 현장에서도 큰 인기였습니다. 본인은 영 탐탁치 않아 했지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Draculina_2: 박쥐 드론에 난도질 당하는 적을 보는 것은 드라큐리나의 프라이드를 크게 만족시켜줍니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Draculina_3: 드라큐리나의 인간조차 아래로 보는 안하무인 성격은 의도적으로 조형되었습니다.
  과거 관계자의 말을 따르자면, ‘콧대 높은 꽃일수록 꺾는 보람이 있다’라고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Draculina_4: 귀하게 자라서 그럴까요? 드라큐리나는 다치거나 아픈 것을 극도로 두려워합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Draculina_5: 드라큐리나는 태생적으로 진동, 즉 음파를 아주 예민하게 감지할 수 있습니다.
  해당 기능을 구현하느라 생산비가 뛰어올라 신체 스펙을 낮춰야 했습니다만, 그녀의 ‘진짜’ 소비자들은 오히려 그것을 환영했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Ran_1: 순식간에 접근한 뒤 일섬. 당하는 쪽은 무슨 일이 일어났는지도 모를 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Ran_2: 모든 감각을 집중하고, 특히나 예민한 시각까지 개방한 전투태세입니다. 다만 그에 따른 리스크는 어쩔 수 없습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Ran_3: 부츠는 그녀가 사용하는 유일한 기계장비입니다. 먼 거리를 순식간에 좁혀 호위 대상을 보호해야하기 때문이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Ran_4: 안타깝게도 그녀에겐 감각의 감도를 낮출 방법이 없습니다. 이를 악물고 버티거나, 익숙해지거나. 해결책은 둘 중 하나입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Hirume_1: 히루메의 무장은 신성한 무녀의 모습을 보일 수 있도록 고안되었습니다. 히루메가 방울을
  흔들면, 삼족오가 나타나 불꽃을 일으키는 것은 훌륭한 퍼포먼스가 되었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Hirume_2: 부적 형태의 장치에서 발생되는 보호막은 주요 수입국의 환경에서는 충분한 방호를 제공했습니다. 히루메의 복장으로도 휴대하기 용이하기도 했고요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Hirume_3: 곁에만 두어도 좋지 않은 것을 쫓아낼 수 있는 신성한 느낌을 내기 위해 삼안 산업에선
  히루메의 신체 조형에 갖은 공을 들였습니다. 결과과 성공적이었음은 말할 필요도 없겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Hirume_4: 히루메의 소속 변경은 비단 성격 문제 뿐만 아니라, 일본 시장 잠식을 위한 고도의 정치적
  계산의 결과였지만, 불행히도 소비자들은 그녀의 소속에 별다른 신경을 쓰지 않고 원하는 대로 활용하곤 했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Hirume_5: 당신이 곁에 있을 때, 꼬리의 털이 빳빳히 서있지 않다면 일단 경계심은 옅어진
  상태입니다. 만약 아홉 꼬리가 기분좋게 살랑이고 있다면 히루메는 완전히 당신에게 마음을 연 것이므로, 꼬리나 귀, 머리를 쓰다듬어달라고
  은근한 눈빛을 보내더라도 놀라지 마세요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Tiamat_1: 견고한 장갑에도 틈은 있기 마련이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Tiamat_2: ......하얗게......불태웠어요......
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Tiamat_3: 안타까운 일이지만, 알아내고 말았습니다. 사령관님의...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Tiamat_4: 일점돌파는 예나 지금이나 유효한 전법입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Tiamat_5: 안 그런 척하지만, 예상외의 상황에는 약한 듯합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Mercury_1: |-
  비전투용인 "페타소스"를 개조해서 가공할 파괴력이 생겨난 건 아니지만,
  머큐리의 다양한 활용법으로 전략적 가치를 인정받았습니다. 
  주된 사용 방식은 적의 움직임을 지연시켜 특정 아군의 협동 공격을 유도하는 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Mercury_2: 본녀가 여러분들에게 최상의 시간을 선사해 드리겠사와요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Mercury_3: |-
  홀로 국제공항을 관리할 만큼 멀티태스킹이 뛰어난 머큐리는 전장에서도 두각을 드러냈습니다.
  아군을 지원하면서 적군의 정찰까지 동시에 해냈죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Mercury_4: |-
  수많은 드론을 조종하는 머큐리에게 몇몇 동료를 추가 지원하는 정도는
  별거 아니었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Mercury_5: |-
  강력한 적을 최우선적으로 견제하는 이유는,
  친우들에게 피해가 가는 걸 미리 방지하기 위해서입니다.
  머큐리가 동료를 얼마나 소중히 여기는지는 다들 잘 알고 있지만,
  머리맡에 뭘 두고 가는 건 조금 자제해달라고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Lancer_1: 중무장한 기병의 돌격은 과거나 지금이나 효과적입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Lancer_2: 라비아타는 랜서가 공방일체의 전술을 구사할 수 있기를 바랬습니다. 바로 랜서가 방패를 든 이유죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Lancer_3: 쐐기 진형을 통한 돌격은 아군의 피탄 면적을 줄이면서 공격력을 극대화시켜 줍니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Ullr_1: 빔 무기의 약점이 한 점만을 공격하는 것일까요? 여러 갈래로 쏘는 빔을 보면, 그런 생각은 사라질 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Ullr_2: 적이 어디에 있는지 모르겠다면, 있을 법한 모든 곳을 공격하면 됩니다. 그럼... 저 폐허 속 어딘가에는 있었을 테니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Ullr_3: 우르는 오랜 세월을 혼자서 지낸 탓에 반드시 누군가가 곁에 있어야 합니다.  그녀는 동료와
  함께라면 강하지만, 홀로 남는다면 그저 가녀린 소녀일 뿐입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Ullr_4: 저격수라고 해서 근거리 전투에 취약한 것은 아닙니다. 저기 널브러진 적의 몸에 난 구멍이 바로 그 증거입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Ullr_5: 저격수가 모습을 드러내는 상황에는 반드시 이유가 있습니다. 섣불리 공격했다간 우르의 중계 드론만 충전될 뿐이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Ullr_F1: 빔 무기의 장점은 적을 관통하는 것입니다. 중계 드론에 집속, 증폭된 빔은 가로막는 모든 것을 뚫어 버릴 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Ullr_F2: 예로부터 엄폐한 적을 효과적으로 제압하기 위한 시도는 꾸준히 이루어져왔습니다. 중계 드론을
  통해 빔을 굴절시킨다는 방법은 누구도 생각해내지 못한 것 같지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_ST_Ullr_F4: 그래도 저격수의 본분은 원거리에서 아군에게 위협이 되는 요소를 확실하게 제압하는 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_JangHwa_1: IED제조, 은밀기동, 민심장악 등. 장화는 테러에 필요한 모든 지식을 갖고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_JangHwa_2: 날카로워 보이는 겉모습에 비해 피해가 적다고 안심해서는 안됩니다. 진짜는 시작도 하지 않았으니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_JangHwa_3: 도움 같은 거, 필요 없어.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_JangHwa_4: 하. 고작 이정도야?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_JangHwa_5: 도와줘서 고맙다고? 킥, 사냥감을 뺏기는 멍청이가 할 법한 말이네.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_JangHwa_F1: 그녀가 손가락을 튕기는 소리가, 희생양이 살아서 듣는 마지막 소리입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_JangHwa_F2: 그녀가 손가락을 튕기는 소리가, 희생양이 살아서 듣는 마지막 소리입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_JangHwa_F4: 하. 고작 이정도야?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Cheona_1: |-
  점퍼 안에 넣어둔 단검들은 양산품입니다.
  한번 쓰고 버려도 언제든 다시 보충할 수 있어서 투척용으로 알맞습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Cheona_2: 찌르고, 썰고, 토막내는 것. 천아가 가장 좋아하는 일이자 가장 잘하는 일입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Cheona_3: |-
  잠입 및 암살 임무에 특화된 천아는 주변에 아무도 없는 걸 선호합니다.
  혼자서 은밀히 행동해야 그녀가 제 실력을 발휘할 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Cheona_4: 상대의 숨통이 끊어질 때까지 천아는 단검을 쥔 두 손을 멈추지 않을 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Cheona_5: |-
  동물 유전자 발현을 제대로 조절하는 데에 실패해서 천아는 체온 조절이 불안정합니다.
  더위는 어느 정도 견딜 수 있지만, 추위만큼은 질색인 그녀에게 핫팩은 필수 아이템이나 다름 없죠.
  당신을 만난 뒤부터는 핫팩보다 함장실을 더 자주 찾지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Vargr_1: |-
  악명 높은 늑대의 이빨이 찢어발기지 못하는 것은 없습니다.
  존재한다고요? 아직 만나지 못했나보군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Vargr_2: |-
  스콜과 하티가 마침내 해와 달을 집어삼키면 세상은 영원한 어둠에 휩싸이고, 진정한 종말이 찾아온다고 합니다.
  물론 이는 어디까지나 전설이지만 스콜과 하티를 뽑아든 바르그와 마주한 적들에게는 크게 다를 게 없을 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Vargr_3: |-
  여제에게는 많은 적이 있었습니다.
  그러나 그 누구도 여제에게 손끝 하나 대지 못했습니다.
  가장 충실한 번견이 그녀의 곁을 지키고 있었으니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Vargr_4: |-
  세상만사는 차고 이지러지는 것이 순리.
  스콜과 하티도 예외는 아닙니다.
  그러나 그 순리를 읽어내고 둘의 힘을 동시에 끌어낸다면 대적할 수 있는 자가 없을 겁니다.
  둘의 힘을 끌어올리는 방법요? 피를 먹이세요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Vargr_5: |-
  바르그의 무기는 스콜과 하티만 있는 것이 아닙니다.
  그녀는 처형 전에 철저하게 모든 변수를 통제하고 가장 확실하게 상대를 척살할 수 있는 상황을 만들어냅니다.
  여제께서 목표의 죽음을 바라시니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Empress_1: 자, 이제 언니가 간다!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Empress_2: 차가워져라! 차가워져라! 펭귄펭귄 꽝!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Empress_3: 경계색과 은신이 모두 적용되는 희귀한 예입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Empress_4: 남위 66도 33분 이하에선 필수 능력입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Saetti_1: 과거, 무장이 연막탄과 섬광탄이었을 때는 그에 충분히 대비한 밀렵꾼들에 의해 불행한 일들이 많이 벌어지곤 했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Saetti_2: 세띠는 사실 구르는 것을 별로 좋아하지 않습니다. 자신이 구른다면 위험한 상황이라는 뜻이기도 하고, 조금 어지럽기도 하거든요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Saetti_3: 겁많고 약해보인다고 걱정하지 않으셔도 됩니다. 세띠의 방탄복은 꽤나 튼튼한데다 안쪽은 푹신푹신하고 아늑하니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Aurora_1: 공격을 위해 출력을 올리면 섬세한 제어가 힘들어 진다고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Aurora_2: 오늘의 디저트는... 짠! 민트초코 케익이에요! 어, 어? 싸우다 도망가시면 어떡해요...!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Aurora_3: 신라천... 아, 이게 아닌가?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Aurora_4: 아우로라가 항상 휘감고 다니는 페로몬에 가까운 향기입니다. 화려한 외모와 더불어 멸망 전 그녀의 유명세에 크게 일조했다고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sunny_1: 이걸 훌라후프라고 불러도 써니는 딱히 화를 내진 않을 겁니다. 아마... '오, 그렇게
  보일수도 있겠네? 한 번 해볼까?' 라고 하지 않을까요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sunny_2: 예전에는 진짜 호랑이와 교감하며 공연했다고 합니다. 아, 동명의 친칠라와는 관계 없으니 안심하세요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sunny_3: 써니의 전투는 한 편의 공연이나 다름없습니다. 이런 멋진 공연을 바로 눈 앞에서 볼 수
  있다니... 써니의 동료들은 분명히 기뻐하겠죠. 적들은 아니겠지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sunny_4: 행복해서 웃는 게 아니에요. 웃으니까 행복해지는 거죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Faucre_1: 과거 어떤 병의 상징과도 같지만, 실제로 쓸 수 있으면 아무래도 상관없어집니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Faucre_2: 이 필살기가 나온 후, 왠지 모르게 벨트 판매량이 크게 늘었다고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Faucre_3: 뽀끄루 외의 단어는 기억하지 못하게 되는 치명적인 부작용이 있습니다...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Faucre_4: 방영 당시 기록에 따르면 뽀끄루 대마왕의 한 화당 전투 시간은 3분을 넘긴 적이 없다고 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Faucre_5: 시간과 예산이 좀 더 필요해지는 시점입니다. 살아만 있다면 언젠가 좋은 날이 오겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Lumberjane_1: 멸망 전쟁 시기에 개조된 럼버제인의 톱은 맹렬히 회전하는 톱날을 적에게 발사할 수 있습니다. 의외로 명중률이 높다구요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Lumberjane_2: 아무리 짜증나게 굴어도 엘븐 애들한테 전기톱을 들이대진 않았어. 갈등해결을
  위해 제대로 된 의사소통을 나눴다고. ...뭐, 가끔씩은 물리적인 수단을 동원하기는 했는데...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Lumberjane_3: 꼭 해야 하는 일은 서둘러 끝내는 타입입니다. 그래야 남는 시간에 쉴 수 있으니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackWyrm_1: 최선의 보호는 위험 요소를 제거하는 것이죠. 그런 의미에서 그녀의 방패는 어느쪽으로나 유용합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackWyrm_2: 주로 활동하던 무대에 걸맞게 강력한 화력을 자랑합니다. 물론 블랙 웜의 보호대상은 머리카락 한 올도 그슬리지 않죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackWyrm_3: 블랙 웜을 공격한다는 것은 보호 대상을 공격한다는 것과 같죠. 적은 그녀의 조용한 분노를 피할 수 없을 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackWyrm_4: 그녀의 보호를 받는다면 열기가 가득한 전장에서도 안심할 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_BlackWyrm_5: 보호 대상을 지키기 위해 그녀는 그 어떤 고통도 감내해냅니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiZero_1: 평소에 쿠나이를 어디 숨겨두는지는 묻지 말아주세요. 닌자에겐 비밀이 많은 법이니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiZero_2: 아무리 은밀함을 중시하는 닌자라도 필살기, 오의를 사용할때는 기술명을 외쳐야 합니다. ...진짜로요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiZero_3: 쿠노이치 제로가 익힌 '무라사키류'는 물이 흐르는 듯한 전투를 지향합니다. 적들 사이를 춤추듯 오갈수록 점점 빠르고 날카로워지죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiZero_4: 쿠노이치 제로가 출연했던 퓨전 사극 '시들어버린 무로마치의 꽃'에는 다양한
  대본이 준비되어 있었습니다. 복수를 이루는 것도, 실패하는 것도, 왕자님을 만나는 것도 있었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_SnowFeather_1: 스노우 페더를 껴안을 땐 소매에 숨겨진 이 수리검에 찔리지 않게 조심하세요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_SnowFeather_2: 날개를 겸하는 증폭기와 소형 드론을 이용한 강력한 화력, 아니 빙결능력으로 기존
  컴패니언들과 차별화되는 점은 스노우 페더의 세일즈 포인트 중 하나였습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_SnowFeather_3: 스노우 페더의 개발 초기, 유사시 호위 대상을 품에 안고 현장을 이탈하는 것에
  방해가 된다는 이유로 그녀의 체형을 바꾸려는 시도는 일부 연구진의 극렬한 반대로 무산되었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_SnowFeather_4: 전개된 스노우 페더의 하얀 날개에서는 냉기가 흘러나옵니다. 여름철 냉방비를 아낄
  수도 있었겠지만, 스노우 페더 모델을 구매했던 사람들은 전부 그런 건 조금도 신경 쓰지 않는 사람들이었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_HighElven_1: 이 빛무리는 사실 급속배양액을 담은 나노머신입니다. 목표에 닿으면 순식간에 싹을 틔워 적을 옭아맵니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_HighElven_2: 청아한 노랫소리와 함께 지친 몸에 활력이 돌아오는 것은 그때의 인간과
  바이오로이들에게도 마법 같은 경험이었을 겁니다. 얼마 후 한번에 찾아오는 피로 정도야 사소한 문제였죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_HighElven_3: 나노봇에 담긴 용액은 물론 자신에게도 사용할 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_HighElven_4: 세레스티아는 보거나 묻지 않아도 같은 엘븐시리즈의 상태를 대략적이나마 파악할 수 있습니다. 기다랗고 예민한 귀가 비밀일지도 모르겠네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_HighElven_5: 받은 것보다 더 많이 주고 싶은 것. 그게 어머니의 마음 아닐까요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Andvari_1: 소녀는 말없이 총을 꺼내 적의 머리에 총알을 박아 넣었고, 그 자리에 있던 발할라의
  모든 병사들은 그 소녀의 참신한 해결법에 감탄을 금치 못했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Andvari_2: 깐깐한 꼬마 군수 담당자의 쉴 새 없는 잔소리는 결과적으로 발할라 병사들의 높은 명중률에 큰 도움이 되었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Andvari_3: 상황에 따라서 뜨뜻한 한 끼 식사보다 야무진 여동생의 조언이 더 든든하게 느껴질 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Dryad_1: 이 길고 거대한 도구는 상대를 가리지 않습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Dryad_2: 충실한 드리아드는 자신의 주인을 지키기 위해서라면 무슨 일이라도 할 것입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Dryad_3: 낫을 들고 있는 노동자를 억압하는 것은 매우 위험한 행동입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Dryad_4: 메이드 복장을 한 그녀들은 금빛 수확을 기대하며 각자의 소매를 걷어붙였습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sadius_1: 전기 같은 걸 끼얹나?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sadius_2: ...결국 상부에서는, 사디어스에게 무력화에 대한 기준을 따로 하달할 수밖에 없었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sadius_3: 이미 체포해 무력화된 상태의 범죄자라도, 사디어스의 비공식적인 추가 처벌은 피할 수 없었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sadius_4: 사디어스가 보이는 기행들은 종종 주변 사람들에게 묘한 감정을 불러일으키곤 했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sadius_5: 사디어스는 동료들이 너무 무르다고 생각했고, 자신이 본보기가 되기로 결정했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiKaen_1: 드라마의 설정 작업중에 이런 거대한 태도가 고증에 맞는지에 대한 토론이 이어지던 중 누군가 이렇게 말했습니다. '멋있으면 된 거 아닐까?'
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiKaen_2: 무장인 히트 블레이드의 출력을 최대로 올린 뒤 일섬. 누군가의 오의와 비슷해보인다면, 기분 탓입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiKaen_3: 타오르는 불꽃과도 같은 카엔의 전투 방식 때문에, 적들은 그녀가 지나가기만
  해도 화상을 입곤 했습니다... 라는 드라마의 설정이 있었습니다. 덕분에 특수효과 팀이 고생 좀 했다네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_KunoichiKaen_4: 작중에서 카엔은 낮에는 다이묘의 호위무사로, 밤에는 주공의 정적을 처리하는 암살자로 활동했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hraesvelgr_1: 흐레스벨그는 기본적으로 전자전 지원기이지만, 필요로 한다면 자신이 직접 나서는 것도 주저하지 않았습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hraesvelgr_2: 이미 차단된 번호입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hraesvelgr_3: 작전의 효율과 안전을 위해, 제 통제를 따라주시기 바랍니다.ー흐레스벨그
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hraesvelgr_4: 전자전에서 우위를 빼앗긴 적들은, 흐레스벨그가 여유롭게 비행하는 모습을 그저 지켜볼 수밖에 없었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_ALWraith_1: 틈만 나면 훈련에 매진하는 덕분에, 레이스는 제트팩 사용 중에도 백발백중의 명중률을
  자랑합니다. 훈련 중엔 다른 대원들과 이야기할 필요가 없어서 좋다나요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_ALWraith_2: 가능하다면 메이의 공격을 유도하는 것이 당연히 확실합니다. 복귀 후에 작은 대장님의 우쭐거림에 반나절 동안 시달려야되긴 하지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_ALWraith_3: 제트팩 사용 중엔 은폐 효율이 떨어지지만, 넓은 시야를 얻을 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_ALWraith_4: 둠 브링어 대원들과 어울리는 레이스의 모습을 보는 것은 하늘의 별 따기입니다. 그런데 그게 그나마 친한 편이라는 게 놀랍군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Poi_1: 프로토타입은 때때로 기대 이상의 성능을 발휘하곤 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Poi_2: 포이는 위협이 될만한 요소를 사전에 제거해두는 편입니다. 그것도 굉장히 잔혹한 방식으로 말이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Poi_3: 호기심은 포이를 흥분시킵니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Poi_4: 포이가 뭔가를 주시한 채 규칙척인 템포로 엉덩이를 흔들고 있다면, 그 자리를 서둘러 피하는 것이 좋습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Poi_5: 특유의 유연함과 뛰어난 반사 신경 덕분에, 포이는 부상을 입는 일이 거의 없었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Leanne_1: 철충과 싸우는 지금은 과거 경찰로 활동할 때와는 위협의 의미가 조금 다릅니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Leanne_2: 무인 경찰서에 배치되어있는 헬기를 호출합니다. 연막탄, 최루탄, 폭죽 등 다양한 지원을 받을 수 있죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Leanne_3: 리앤은 직급에 어울리지 않게 현장에 직접 나가는 것을 선호했습니다. 초천재 미소녀 형사라는 별명은 그래서 붙은 것은 아니고, 스스로 붙였고요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Leanne_4: 080기관과 시티가드 바이오로이드들은 대부분 사이가 안 좋았지만, 가끔 친구가 되는 경우도 있었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Leanne_5: 리앤이 정의를 실형하는 것에 집착하게된 것은, '즐거운 토모'와 관계가 있을지도 모르겠네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Eternity_1: 이터니티의 대표적인 무장 HMG 'R.I.P.'입니다. 대물용으로 제작되어 있으며, 하루 종일 퍼부을 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Eternity_2: 이터니티의 관에서 튀어나오는 3자루의 HMG 'R.I.P.'를 보고 있자면 전의를 상실할 수밖에 없었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Eternity_3: 이터니티가 늘 들고다니는 관은 경호 대상을 보호하는데 쓰이곤 했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Eternity_4: 노련한 메이드인 이터니티는 실수 없는 완벽한 경호 능력을 보여주었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Eternity_5: 이터니티는 경호 대상이 조금이라도 다칠 경우 육중한 무장들을 특유의 근력을 바탕으로 그 누구보다 재빠르게 움직여 적을 제압할 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Azaz_1: 철충을 해체하는 것은 손쉬운 일이지만, 사실 아자즈는 해체보단 조립을 더 좋아합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Azaz_2: 기계 공학의 정수가 담겨 있는 골든 팩토리의 기능은 아직 밝혀지지 않은 것이 더 많습니다. 개인 시간에 취미삼아 만든 것인데도 말이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Azaz_3: 아자즈의 은밀한 취미는... 부품을 몇 개씩 챙겨서 혼자 수제 프라모델을 만드는 거라고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Azaz_4: 철충과의 전투를 좋아하진 않지만, 일단 전장에 나서면 아자즈의 공학 지식은 큰 도움이 됩니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Azaz_5: 아자즈는 모든 기계 장치의 구조를 꿰뚫고 있습니다. 혼자서도 얼마든지 작업이 가능하지만, 믿음직한 보조가 있다면 일이 훨씬 쉬워지겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_LemonadeAlpha_1: 레모네이드의 강력한 해킹 능력은 AGS와 철충은 물론, 바이오로이드의 모듈에도 제한적으로나마 효과를 발휘할 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_LemonadeAlpha_2: 케스토스 히마스의 코어가 회전하기 시작한다는 것은 알파가 전장을 완전히 장악했다는 뜻입니다. 곧 출력을 전개해 적들을 완전히 무력화하겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_LemonadeAlpha_3: 레모네이드들의 케스토스 히마스엔 대부분의 전투 상황에 대응할 수 있는 특화 OS가 설치되어 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_LemonadeAlpha_4: 케스토스 히마스에는 전투 OS외에도, 정찰 정보 분석, 광대역 통신망, 재무 관리, 일정 관리를 위한 다양한 소프트웨어가 담겨 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_LemonadeAlpha_5: 제작 시에 간단한 조리를 위한 전자 레인지 등이 설치될 계획도 입안되었다고 하는데, 한 번 찾아보시는 것도 좋겠네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Ella_1: 원래 대기 성분을 측정하던 장비를 전투용으로 개수했습니다. 비슷한 다른 기술과는 달리 상당한 위력을 발휘합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Ella_2: 궤도상에 떠 있는 인공위성으로부터 에너지를 전송 받아 아군을 강화합니다. 비슷한 다른 기술과는 달리 공격 능력은 없습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Ella_3: 체력이 약한 엘라의 움직임을 보조하는 장치입니다. 오랫동안 이것에 의존해서 활동하다
  보니, 비전투원이면서도 전투 상황에서 최소한의 안전을 확보할 수 있게 되었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Ella_4: "'천사의 숨결'은 기본적으로 유해한 물질을 막는 성질을 지니나, 약간의 조정을 거치면 그 반대의 작용을 하게 만드는 것도 가능합니다."
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Ella_5: 작은 소녀가 빛 무리에 휘감겨 기도를 하는 모습은 진짜 천사처럼 보일지도 모르겠네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Rena_1: 지옥에서 날아온 이 래리어트는 상대 선수들에게 공포의 대상이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Rena_2: 피니쉬 무브로 드롭킥을 사용하는 경우는 많지 않지만, 레나의 쇼맨쉽과 외골격의 백업을
  받은 강력한 임팩트로 인해 충분한 설득력을 가지게 되었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Rena_3: 레나 본인도 태그팀 매치를 선호하지 않았지만, 레나와 같은 팀이 되는 선수 또한 그랬습니다. 혼자 너무 날뛴다나요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Rena_4: 레나의 인기몰이 원인 중 하나는 상대 선수, 관중, 시청자, 협회 등을 대상으로 하는 현란한 마이크웍이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Rena_5: 음... 이걸 맞고 일어날 수 있는 상대가 있을까요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Mery_1: 튼튼하기로 유명한 비스마르크의 제품은 단순히 집어던지는 것만으로도 충분히 위협적입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Mery_2: 이 그림에는 가장 깊은 곳에 있는 욕망이 담겨 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Mery_3: 메리의 작품을 선점하기 위한 노력은 계속됩니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Mery_4: 난 괜찮으니까, 저번에 부탁했던 거나 마저 그려줄래? - 블러디 팬서
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Machina_1: 수십 미터가 넘는 운석이 떨어지는 장면이었지만, 마키나에게는 연출팀의 어떤 도움도 필요 없었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Machina_2: 어딜 보고 계시는 거죠? 그건 제 홀로그램입니다만?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Machina_3: 누구나 이야기의 주인공이 되고 싶어 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Machina_4: 승리의 주문은 필요 없습니다. 이곳에선 모두가 주인공이니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Machina_5: 사실, 마키나의 드론에는 기본적인 전투 기능이 탑재되어 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Salamander_1: 버닝 워커의 화염은 살아있는 적보단 시체와 잔해를 더 많이 불태웠습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Salamander_2: 그다지 특이할 것 없는 호드의 전술 기동입니다만, 샐러맨더는 거기에 소망을 담아
  이름을 붙였습니다. 도박을 좋아하긴 하지만, 그다지 운이 좋진 않거든요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Salamander_3: 호드 대원들은 전투 시작 전, 누가 더 많은 적을 처리하는지 내기를 하곤
  했습니다. 전투와 도박을 동시에 할 수 있는 기회를 샐러맨더가 놓칠리가 없었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Salamander_4: 샐러맨더는 스스로의 생명에 별다른 가치를 두지 않습니다. 거기다 짜릿한 전투를
  즐기기까지 하니, 광소와 함께 전열을 헤집는 샐러맨더는 적들에겐 공포의 대상이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scarabya_1: |-
  별거 아닌 고철과 잡동사니더라도 충분한 질량만 있다면 유효한 피해를 입힐 수 
  있습니다.
  던졌다고 사라지는 것도 아니니, 
  잘만 하면 쓰러뜨린 적의 부품까지 덤으로 수거할 수 있었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scarabya_2: |-
  조금 따끔할 수도 있어. 견딜 수 없이 아프면 손 들어. 
  ...잠깐! 튜닝 중에 움직이면 위험해. 얌전히 있어.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scarabya_3: |-
  편안히 잠든 스카라비아를 깨워야 할 땐 조심하셔야 합니다. 
  무턱대고 그녀에게 다가갔다간, 
  "자동 방어" 모드의 메카 암에 제압당하기 십상이거든요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scarabya_4: |-
  카페인과 니코틴을 잔뜩 보충한 스카라비아는 여느 때보다 뛰어난 능력을 
  발휘합니다. 
  이 상태가 오래 지속 되지 않아, 간간이 커피나 담배를 보충해줘야 하지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Scarabya_5: |-
  적들이 가지고 있던 물건으로 기괴한 뭔가를 만들어 냅니다. 
  스카라비아는 기능성이 뛰어난 제품이라 주장하고, 진짜로 작전 효율도 눈에 띄게 증가하지만... 적들이 겁에 질려보이는 건 또 다른 효과겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hyena_1: 전투 중의 하이에나는 어떻게 적을 폭발시킬지에 대한 생각밖에 하지 않습니다. 자신의 안전은 전혀 고려사항이 아니죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hyena_2: 하이에나는 자신의 샷건을 폭탄 소지량을 제한하는 방해물 정도로 여기지만, 성능만큼은 신뢰하고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hyena_3: 광기는 전염된다고 하죠. 연합전쟁 당시, 칸을 뒤따라 진입한 하이에나들은 서로가 일으키는 폭발을 보고 더욱 흥분하여 날뛰곤 했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Triton_1: 메인디쉬에 앞서 전채요리가 나오듯, 본격적인 화력 투사 전의 경고 사격또한
  필요합니다. 물론, '고작' 경고 사격정도도 버텨내지 못한 적이 수두룩 했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Triton_2: 숨을 곳은 없습니다. 정확히는, 숨은 곳과 함께 먼지가 되겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Triton_3: 트리톤에 설치된 전투 모듈의 목적은 단 하나, 적군의 섬멸. 이를 달성하는데 방해되는
  요소가 감지된다면, 원인을 분석하고 과정을 연산한 뒤 결과를 달성해냅니다. 즉, 목표가 된 대상이 어떻게 행동하더라도 '섬멸'이란 결말에서
  벗어날 수 없습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Triton_4: 일단 트리톤의 막강한 화력을 버텨내고, 이후에 빈틈을 노리겠다는 안일한 판단을 한 적들의 말로는 정해져 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Triton_5: 안일한 적들에게 대가를 징수할 때입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Albatross_1: 플라즈마 포는 장갑을 녹이고 들어갈 수 있지.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Albatross_2: 무릎 꿇어라! 더러운 것들!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Albatross_3: 자! 모두 통제를 따르도록!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Albatross_4: 모두! 준비해라! 적의 위치를 전송하겠다!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Albatross_5: 스스로를 지킬 능력이 없다면 올바른 지휘관이라고 할 수 없다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Seljuq_1: 직사포는 실제로 피해를 주는 것도 중요하지만 적의 진격을 저지하는데 더욱 중요합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Seljuq_2: AGS위성과 GPS 동기화됨.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Seljuq_3: 때로는 관통력보다는 폭발력이 중요합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Gigantes_1: 탄환 소모할 가치가 없음
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Gigantes_2: 물러나기를 요청. 위협 사격 및 돌격 전술을 전개함.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Gigantes_3: 보호함.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Gigantes_4: 기간테스. 탄환보다 철권을 선호.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Fallen_1: 테러 진압용 머신건. 테러에는 체포보다는 사살이 우선됨.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Fallen_2: 중장갑 유닛은 폴른의 가장 큰 적이었습니다. 폴른은 장갑 유닛을 상대하기 위해 충격파를
  이용해 장갑에 균열을 만드는 것으로 자신의 천적을 극복했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_SJ_Orellia_1: 오렐리아는 검술의 대가입니다만, 직접 칼을 맞대는 것보단 중거리에서 마력칼날을 쏘아내는 것을 선호합니다. 그게 더 우아하다나요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_SJ_Orellia_2: 비틀린 나선의 형상을 한 지팡이검으로 불러내는 이 용은 오렐리아의 운명을 상징합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_SJ_Orellia_3: 세계적인 대히트 게임, ‘인공영웅‘의 주인공 파티에서, 오렐리아는 어머니와 같은 역할을
  담당했습니다. 주로 어디로 사라질지 모르는 타치가 보살핌의 대상이었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_SJ_Orellia_4: 오렐리아는 귀족 집안 출신으로, 소속되어 있던 원소마법 학회에서도 상당히 높은 위치에
  있었습니다. 하지만 자신에게 주어진 운명을 깨닫고, 세계를 구하기 위해 여행을 나섰죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_SJ_Tachi_1: 별도로 판매하는 전용장비를 검에 장착하면 다른 속성의 검술을 펼칠 수 있습니다. 3개를
  한번에…? 시도해보시는 건 자유지만, 본사에선 그로 인한 결과에 귀책사유가 없다는 점을 고지해 드립니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_SJ_Tachi_2: 암살자라면 하늘을 날아다니며 숨겨진 힘을 해방시켜야 한다는 컨셉 기획안은 연출팀을 한층 성장시켰습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_SJ_Tachi_3: 타치가 가지고 다니는 천봉유성검은 극도로 예리한 도검입니다. 트럭으로 배송하던 중 검의
  거치대가 뒤집혀 차량을 두 동강 낸 사건은 업계에서 전설처럼 내려오고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_SJ_Tachi_4: 타치는 누구보다 민첩했습니다. 특히 전투에서 눈으로 좇기 힘든 속도로 적들을 마구 베어 넘기는 모습은 동료들을 당황하게 만들곤 했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Erato_1: |-
  유전 공학적으로 완벽한 성대를 소유한 에라토는 
  특별한 능력을 지니고 있습니다. 
  목소리만으로 상대방의 감정을 증폭시키는 건 물론, 
  철충의 핵심 부품이 지닌 고유 진동수와 공명하여 파손시킬 수도 있죠. 
  이 능력이 적극 사용되는 장소는 주로
  팬들과 교류할 수 있는 무대 위에서라고 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Erato_2: 그때의 감동을, 지금 이곳에서 다시 한 번 경험하실 준비 되셨습니까?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Erato_3: |-
  천성 가수인 에라토는 혼자 길을 걷다가도 
  무심코 노래를 흥얼거리는 경우가 잦습니다.
  가끔씩 그 음색에 끌려 작은 새들이 날아오기도 하고, 
  주변을 지나가던 불면증 소유자들은 선 채로 
  깊은 숙면에 빠지는 경우가 잦았다고 하네요.​
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Erato_4: |-
  팬들에게 받아온 관심과 애정에 보답할 수 있는 유일한 방법은
   최고의 공연을 선보이는 것뿐이라고, 그것만이 자신의 꿈이라고
  에라토는 이야기합니다. 
  언젠가 최대 규모의 공연장에서 자신의 꿈을 이루게 되면
  그땐 당신에게 전하고 싶은 말이 있다고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Erato_5: |-
  스타 기질이 다분한 에라토는 현장에서 팬들과 미팅하는 게 즐겁답니다. 
  휴일에도 방에 앉아있기보다는 밖으로 나가는 편인데, 
  오늘은... 벌써 팬들과 소통하러 갔나보군요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Muse_1: 같은 노래라도 음향 장비의 질에 따라 느낌이 확 달라지는 법. 다른 것에는 별로 관심이 없는 뮤즈도 장비만은 항상 최고급으로 유지합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Muse_2: 특별 제작된 뮤즈의 기타는 전장과 같은 극한 상황에서도 연주가 가능합니다. 신청곡은…
  음… 덜덜 떨고 있는 연주자의 상태를 보니 좀 어려워 보이네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Muse_3: 무대공포증에 더불어 대인기피 성향을 보이는 뮤즈이지만, 일단 악기를 잡고 자기만의 세계로 들어간다면 어디서든 훌륭한 음악을 들려줄 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Muse_4: 뮤즈의 가장 큰 소망은 역시 무대에 올라 노래할 수 있게 되는 것이죠. 다른 하나는…
  그녀가 남몰래 탐독하는 로맨스 소설을 보면 알 수 있을지도요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Boryeon_1: 이유는 알 수 없지만, 체모가 짙고 뚱뚱한 중년 남성 손님은 추가 비용을 내지
  않아도 아주 의욕적이고 헌신적인 서비스를 받을 수 있었다고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Boryeon_2: 과거의 전투 교리는 대상에게 충분히 접근한 뒤 면도칼로 관절 부위 등 취약한 부위를
  파괴하고 부식액을 주입하는 것이었지만, 이런 방식으로도 충분히 효과를 볼 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Boryeon_3: 서비스를 받는 도중, 보련의 숨이 거칠어지고 손이 떨리더라도 신경쓰지 마세요.
  그녀의 뛰어난 손재주라면, 극도의 흥분 상태에서도 피부에는 아주 작은 생채기도 남기지 않을 테니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Boryeon_4: 보련은 백치미가 느껴질 정도로 밝고 착한 심성을 갖고 있으니, 겉모습에 주눅들지
  않으셔도 괜찮습니다. 당신이 무엇을 요구하더라도, 그녀는 헤헤 웃으면서 받아들일 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Orangeade_1: 오렌지에이드는 케스토스 히마스와는 다른 기능의 카두세우스를 보유하고 있습니다. 조작법은 비슷해보여도 다른 성능을 발휘하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Orangeade_2: 카두세우스는 짧은 시간 안에 적을 분석, 약점을 파악하여 아군에게 전달하는
  기능을 갖췄습니다. 다만 하늘 높이 던져야 분석이 시작되는데, 떨어지는 걸 못 잡으면...
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Orangeade_3: 전투에 자신이 없으신가요? 카두세우스의 지원을 받아 보세요. 여태 해온 전투와는 전혀 다른 경험을 하게 될 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Orangeade_4: 함께 임무를 나간 동료들은 오렌지에이드의 원호와 카두세우스의 보조를 받고 최상의 컨디션을 유지하게 됩니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_SpartanC_1: 정지하십시오. 반항할 경우 적대행위로 간주, 사격을 개시할 예정입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_SpartanC_2: 스파르탄즈! 돌격하라!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_SpartanC_3: 스파르탄즈! 어셈블!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_SpartanA_1: 스파르탄 어썰트의 사격으로 적을 견제합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_SpartanA_2: 아군은 즉시 눈을 감으시오!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_SpartanB_1: 그들은 철충이 죽였지. 너는 내가 죽인다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_SpartanB_2: 700년의 역사를 자랑하는 전통적인 무기.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Roc_1: 증기화된 실리카의 표면을 태우면서 만들어집니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Roc_2: 번개는 미드가르드오름의 처치에도 결정적인 역할을 했었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Roc_3: 전자기파는 간섭을 받지 않습니다. 하지만 일부 구역에서 교란될 수는 있죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Roc_4: 차징! 고고 록! 그 이름도 우리의 로크!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Roc_5: 먼저 전자석을 만듭니다. 그리고 내부에서 만들어진 그 전자석은 이 금속 생명에게 더욱 큰 절망을 안겨주겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Fortress_1: 한 때는 이 무기가 모든 전쟁을 끝낼 수 있을 거라 생각된 적도 있었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Fortress_2: 적에게 큰 피해를 주는 가장 확실한 방법은 모든 탄을 퍼붓는 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Fortress_3: 로마시대부터 테스투도는 완벽한 돌격 전술이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Fortress_F1: 기관포는 엄폐된 진지와 토치카에서 최고의 위력을 발휘합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Fortress_F2: 적들이 'Incoming'을 끝까지 외칠 수 있을까요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Fortress_F3: 브라우니가 포트리스를 사랑하는 이유입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Tyrant_1: 타이런트의 목표가 된 대상이 마지막으로 보게 될 풍경은 지축을 울리는 발소리를 배경음
  삼아 날아드는 미사일 탄막과 곧 자신의 숨통을 끊을 폭군의 송곳니입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Tyrant_2: 전장에서 특히 흉포한 포효가 들려온다면 남은 일은 하나입니다. 모조리 잿더미가 된 적을 앞에서 포효하는 타이런트를 진정시키는 일이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Tyrant_3: 지금껏 이 폭군을 후방에 배치하겠다고 생각한 명령권자는 없었습니다. 아, 있었지만 전부 비참한 최후를 맞았을수도 있겠네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Tyrant_4: 보호요? 농담이시겠죠?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Tyrant_5: 상처입은 폭군이 최후의 순간에 취할 행동은 당연히 하나밖에 없습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_RheinRitter_1: 심약한 보병들은 말에 올라탄 기사와 눈이 마주치는 것만으로도 전의를 상실했다고 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_RheinRitter_2: 라인리터는 기동성을 대가로, 보다 강력한 화력을 퍼부을 수 있는 포격 모드로 변형이 가능합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_RheinRitter_3: 라인리터의 기동성은 양산형 포격 지원 AGS 중 최고 수준이었다고 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_RheinRitter_4: 격렬하고 거센, 분노의 시간이요! 파멸의 시간이자, 붉은 새벽의 시간이 왔다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_MrAlfred2_1: "'물질 조형가'의 가장 심플하고도 강력한 능력입니다. 다른 얘기입니다만, 이
  기계팔을 만든 누군가는 멋진 이름을 지었다며 남 몰래 뿌듯해하지 않았을까요?"
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_MrAlfred2_2: 적의 약점을 관찰해 최적화된 공격 수단을 산출해냅니다. 물론 그 공격 수단은 즉석에서 제작하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_MrAlfred2_3: 적의 약점을 공격하고 자신의 강점을 극대화하는 것이야말로 이 로봇이 추구했던 바입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_MrAlfred2_4: 어마어마한 밀도와 질량을 가진 이 합금은 강력한 방호력을 제공합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_MrAlfred2_5: 물론 살아남기 위해선 약점을 보완해야 할 때도 있습니다. 유연함이야말로 생존의 비결이죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Watcher_1: 진정한 의미의 무인기가 탄생했습니다. 윤리와 도덕적 문제에서 해방된 것을 축하 드립니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Watcher_2: 와쳐가 수집해오는 정보들은 양과 질 모든 면에서 지상군을 만족시키기에 충분했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Watcher_3: 가랏! 무인기!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Stronghold_1: 어딘가에 몸을 숨긴다는 생각은 하지 말아주시길 바랍니다. 스트롱홀드에 달린
  6문의 주포는 어떤 엄폐물이라도 스티로폼처럼 부숴 버리고 적을 처치할 테니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Stronghold_2: 뭔가가 분쇄되는 소리가 들려오면 황급히 자리를 피해야 합니다. 고속으로 회전하는
  캐터필러에 갈리고, 490톤에 깔려 뭉개지면 뼈도 추리지 못할 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Stronghold_3: 최강의 성채, 스트롱홀드의 방어력은 내장갑판의 유기적인 구조에서 나옵니다. 대전차지뢰나 미사일 따위론 절대 성채를 무너뜨릴 수 없습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Stronghold_4: 그가 보호하겠다고 마음먹었을 땐 모든 상황은 정해진 것이나 마찬가지입니다.
  계획대로 아군은 모두 무사할 거고, 스트롱홀드도 흠집 없이 멀쩡할 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Stronghold_5: 계란으로 바위 치기라는 말처럼, 스트롱홀드라는 바위는 언제나 적들이라는 계란을 뭉개버릴 준비가 되어있습니다. 아, 좀 다른가요?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sonia_1: |-
  멸망 전쟁 이전에 테러리스트를 상대했던 소니아는 주로 비살상용 탄종을 다뤘습니다. 
  끔찍한 범죄자라 해도 인간을 해치면 안 되니까요.
  하지만 철충이 상대라면 봐줄 필요가 없죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sonia_2: |-
  끊임없이 발사되는 열압력탄의 열기와 충격파가 상호 작용하여 연쇄폭발을 일으킵니다. 
  저 거대한 불꽃 폭풍 속에서는 그 누구도 멀쩡할 수는 없겠죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sonia_3: |-
  사디어스처럼 테러 진압의 스페셜리스트인 소니아는 특출한 직감을 지녔습니다. 
  어떻게 해야 적을 무력화시킬 수 있는지 누가 조언해주지 않아도 이미 알고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sonia_4: |-
  평화로운 오르카 호에선 소니아가 태평한 것처럼 보여도,
  적과 교전한다든지 긴박한 상황 속에서는 냉철한 면모를 드러냅니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sonia_5: |-
  테러리스트가 아무리 완강히 저항해봤자 
  소니아에게는 발버둥치는 걸로밖에 보이질 않았습니다.
  범죄자라면 꼼짝 없이 그녀에게 유린당해야만 했죠. ​

  ...혹시 모르지만, 그녀가 취미를 들먹일 땐 당신도 조심하셔야 할 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Ellie_1: 여러 기능이 탑재된 요원용 양산은 080기관 소속 요원의 장비 중 하나입니다. 이외에도
  칼날이 숨겨진 구두, 신경독이 들어있는 만년필, 라이터 모양의 수류탄 등이 있죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Ellie_2: 양산에 설치된 방호 역장의 출력을 최대로 올릴 경우, 웬만한 폭발 정도는 방어해낼 수 있습니다. 안쪽에서든, 바깥쪽에서든요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Ellie_3: 불행하게도, 서민들을 위해 희생하고 봉사한다는 엘리의 마음가짐은 한 점의 거짓도 없는 진심입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Ellie_4: 시끄러운 전장에서도 티타임을 지나칠 수는 없죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_NickyTracy_1: 꼭 전기톱만이 좋은 대화수단은 아닙니다. 니키가 들고 다니는 빠루와 테슬라 송곳도 훌륭한 대화수단 중 하나죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_NickyTracy_2: 이 기술을 쓰기 위해선 코트를 활짝 열어야 감전의 위험에서 벗어날 수 있습니다. 어차피 안에 옷을 입었으니까 별로 상관은… 어…?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_NickyTracy_3: 니키는 코트에서 나오는 전기를 감당하기 위해 외과수술을 받았습니다. 시술에 쓰인
  약물과 의료 도구를 모으면 방 하나를 가득 채울 정도였죠. 자신을 걱정해주는 동료들에게 니키는 자신이 타고난 육체를 가졌다고 너스레를 떨어
  안심시켰습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_NickyTracy_4: 닥터가 개발한 특제 코트에 모인 전자기는 니키 트레이시가 원하는 시기에, 원하는
  만큼 방출할 수 있습니다. 혼자서 EMP를 터뜨릴 수 있는 셈이죠. 그러고 보니 요즘 복도에 CCTV가 자주 고장 나는데, 혹시…?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_NickyTracy_5: 누가 함장실에 침입한 흔적이 발견됐군요! 왠지 땀을 흘리고 있던 사령관이 괜찮다고
  돌아가라 했지만, 그녀의 의지는 확고합니다. 니키는 범인이 나타날 때까지, 사령관을 위해 이 자리를 지킬 겁니다!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Glacias_1: 글라시아스의 전투 방식은 거대한 몸집과 냉기를 자유자재로 다루는 것에 특화되어
  있습니다. 다만, 가끔씩 자기도 모르게 누군가와의 연계를 염두에 둔 듯한 움직임을 보일때도 있죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Glacias_2: 글라시아스가 휩쓸고 간 곳엔 차가운 죽음이 내려앉습니다. 연합 전쟁 당시, 베링
  해협을 통해 아메리카 대륙에 상륙을 준비하던 삼안의 침투 부대하나도 통째로 얼어붙어버리고 말았습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Glacias_3: 언제나 인자하고 상냥한 글라시아스이지만, 계약을 맺은 맹우에게 해를 끼치는 대상은 용서하지 않습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Glacias_4: 글라시아스의 존재 자체만으로도 어지간한 열기는 버틸 수 있게 됩니다. 그녀가 출연했던 작품에서는 마기를 물리는 효과도 있었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Glacias_5: 영원히 채워지지 않을 그리움이라고 생각했는데… 후후, 운명이란 정말 알다가도 모를 것이구나.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_QueenMane_1: 특수한 슈트는 퀸오브메인을 완벽하게 사자로 의태할 수 있게 해줍니다. 과거엔
  다른 프라이드의 숫사자로 오해하고 덤벼드는 사자무리에 곤혹을 치뤘다고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_QueenMane_2: 퀸오브메인의 이빨은 숨통을 끊기 위한 마무리일격일 뿐입니다. 그녀의 주무기가
  날카로운 발톱이라는 걸 깨닫는 것이 조금만 늦더라도, 순식간에 사냥당하고 말 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_QueenMane_3: 사냥 준비는 신중하게. 사냥이 시작되면 무자비하게. 퀸오브메인의 신조입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_QueenMane_4: 사자는 언제나 무리를 지어 사냥합니다. 비겁하다구요? 야생에서는 살아남은 자가 곧 강자인 법입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Mnemosyne_1: 므네모시네는 생체 전기를 기반으로한 염동력으로, 열 에너지를 자유자재로 다룰 수
  있습니다. 힘을 한 점에 집중시킬 경우, 어떤 대상이라도 순식간에 얼어붙게 만들죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Mnemosyne_2: 컴퓨터에 성격이 없는 것처럼, 므네모시네는 냉정하거나 냉혹한 성격과는 거리가
  있습니다. 명령을 받고 움직이는 그녀에게 공격 당하는 침입자들의 생각은 조금 다를수도 있겠지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Mnemosyne_3: 시설의 관리자라는 역할과 덧없어 보이는 외모 때문에 잘 인식되지는 않지만,
  증폭기로 보조받는 므네모시네의 출력은 ‘일렉트라 프로젝트’의 후기 바이오로이드들과 비슷합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Mnemosyne_4: 침입자를 제거하는 것도 므네모시네의 역할 중 하나였지만, 침입할만한 존재들이 전부 사라진 뒤엔 하루하루 같은 나날의 연속이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Mnemosyne_5: 기억의 방주에서 므네모시네가 가장 많이 열람해 본 자료는 들꽃에 대한
  정보입니다. 이제 굳이 검색해보지 않아도 들꽃들의 이름, 특징과 생김새를 생생히 전달할 수 있죠. 다만, 아직 직접 본 적은 한 번도 없다고
  합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Hussar_1: 후사르의 테슬라 건은 금속과 정밀 회로에 특히 치명적입니다. 공교롭게도 철충은 둘 모두에 속하죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Hussar_2: 제트팩을 이용한 입체적인 기동은 후사르의 장기입니다. 궤도 기지에 설치되어 기동력을
  보조해주는 마그네틱 자이로가 없어도 적을 농락하기엔 충분합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Hussar_3: 청아한 생김새와는 달리, 후사르는 전투 시에 쉽게 흥분합니다. 저돌적으로 적에게
  달려들어 격렬한 전투를 벌이고 난 뒤 항상 후회하지만, 극복하기 쉽지 않다고 하네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Ramiel_1: 라미엘의 존재 덕분에 코헤이 신도들은 악행을 저지르더라도 빛을 향한 진심어린 기도 한
  번이면 용서받을 수 있다고 믿었습니다. 또한 교단내에서의 위치에 따라 면죄받을 수 있는 죄의 범위가 달랐고, 그것은 경전에 아주 세세히
  기록되었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Ramiel_2: 불타오르는 핵융합로로 형상화된 ‘원죄’에 접촉한다면 치명적인 결과를 초래하게 됩니다. 종교적으로는 물론, 물리적으로도요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Ramiel_3: 라미엘은 모든 원죄를 대신해서 짊어진 희생양으로써 태어났습니다. 스스로의 고행을 통해
  다른 신도들이 구원받을 것이라고 여기며 견뎌내는 그녀에게 주어질 구원따위는, 당연히 없었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Ramiel_4: 빛이 내게 시련을 내리시니, 어린 양들은 네 피가 만든 길을 따라 구원에 들 것이라.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_DS_Ramiel_5: 코헤이 교단에서 다루는 원죄는 어둠에 가까운 더러운 것. 당연히 그것을 짊어진 라미엘과
  관련되는 것 또한 불경하다 여겼습니다. 그때문에 라미엘은 누구에게도 위로받지 못한 채 그것을 홀로 이겨내야 했습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Arachne_1: 아라크네의 송곳니는 무턱대고 접근한 적을 무자비하게 뚫어버릴 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Arachne_2: 아라크네의 코일이 드러난다면, 이미 늦었습니다. EMP에 저항할수도, 시간 내에 효과 범위 밖으로 도망갈 수도 없을테니까요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Arachne_3: AGS가 주력이 된 전투에서 적 시스템망에 침입해 무력화하는 전자전은 군대의 기본
  소양이 되었고, 아라크네 또한 침투 능력만큼이나 뛰어난 전자전 방어 능력을 갖췄습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_AGS_Arachne_4: 한 아라크네 개체가 적의 공격을 분석한 뒤, 아군의 A.I.에 침입해 방어 알고리즘을
  개선해 적의 공세를 성공적으로 막아내었고, 이것은 곧 정식 교리가 되었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sekhmet_1: |-
  미생물을 급속도로 배양하는 기능을 탑재한 나노봇의 무리는 마치 폭풍처럼 보입니다.
  만약 유기체가 휘말린다면 그 결과는... 상상하기도 싫네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sekhmet_2: |-
  죽음의 이미지와 차가워 보이는 인상, 모성의 대상을 통제하에 두려는 태도 때문에 오해하기 쉽지만
  세크메트는 사실 무섭거나 대하기 어려운 편은 아닙니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sekhmet_3: |-
  과거, '세계수'를 기르기 위한 사전작업은 세크메트 혼자서 진행하는 것이 일반적이었지만,
  부득이한 경우 엘븐과 다크엘븐 모델들이 투입되는 경우도 있었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sekhmet_4: |-
  이집트 신화의 세 여신은 동일시되었다고 합니다. 비록 이름은 그중 한 명의 것을 빌렸지만,
  함께 지내다 보면 세크메트에게서 다른 여신들의 모습을 찾아볼 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Sekhmet_5: 세레스티아의 자매인 세크메트 또한 모성의 화신입니다. 다만 그 방향성이... 음, 조금 반항하고 싶어질지도 모르겠네요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Peregrinus_1: |-
  페레그리누스의 거대한 날개는 그 존재만으로도 큰 위협이 되었습니다.
  그의 앞을 가로막는 어리석은 적은 날개짓 한 번에 쓰러질 뿐이었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Peregrinus_2: 운동량은 질량과 속도의 곱에 비례합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Peregrinus_3: 비록 각성 전의 모습이긴 하나, 각성 후보다도 빠른 속도로 적을 유린할 수 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Peregrinus_4: 하피의 왕이 되기 위한 조건? 하핫, 그건 하나면 돼. 바로 나… 페레그리누스일 것!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Peregrinus_5: |-
  페레그리누스는 상황에 따라 다른 모습을 오가는 뛰어난 전투 적응력을 발휘합니다. 
  그리고 그건 다른 이와 이야기할때도 마찬가지죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Peregrinus_F1: |-
  '내 친구를 위해서다…!'라는 대사와 함께 니드호그에게 일격을 먹이는 장면은,
  '드래곤 슬레이어'의 명장면 중 하나로 꼽힙니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Peregrinus_F2: 내 힘의 원천? 바로 뜨거운 열정이 흘러 넘치는 심장이지!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_Peregrinus_F3: |-
  최흉의 악룡 니드호그와 싸우기 전, 동료를 지키기 위해 각성한 모습… 이라는 설정입니다. 
  설정이긴 하지만, 그 강력함만은 진짜죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_CyclopsePrincess_1: 사용자의 의지를 따라 적의 피와 생기를 빨아들이는 마검 중의
  마검입니다. 진홍빛 피(Crimson Blood)라는 이명도 있는 모양이지만, 사이클롭스 프린세스는 이렇게 부르는 걸 더 선호한다고 합니다.
  아, 물론 콜론도 포함해서요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_CyclopsePrincess_2: 힘을 봉인한 안대를 벗고, 진조의 위광을 적에게 보이는 기술입니다.
  참고로, 영창은 자기암시를 위한 수단일 뿐이기 때문에 그때그때 달라도 문제 없습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_CyclopsePrincess_3: |-
  사이클롭스 프린세스가 진조이기에 지니는, 세계로부터 획득한 '권리'.
  이 권능을 행사하는데에는 어떤 제약도 존재하지 않습니다.

  '드래곤 슬레이어'의 세계관에서 진조의 최후는 혈통에 새겨진 피의 저주에 짓눌려, 어둠에 잡아먹힌 괴물이 되는 것. 하지만 사이클롭스
  프린세스는 

  그런 운명의 굴레를 극복하고 스스로의 선택으로 빛의 힘을 각성했었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_BlindPrincess_1: |-
  한 때는 피로 물든 마검이었지만,
  지금은 빛의 힘으로 정화되어 성스러운 빛을 내뿜고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_BlindPrincess_2: |-
  앞이 보이지 않는데 어떻게 아군을 보호하냐고요? 간단하죠.
  아군을 위협하는 적을 전부 박살내면 된답니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_BlindPrincess_3: |-
  "섬세한 싸움이 불가능하다는 건, 저 스스로가 누구보다도 더 잘 알고 있어요.
  그렇기에 저는 모든 이를 대신하여 포화를 받아내기로 결심했습니다."

  낡은 공책에는 삐뚤빼뚤한 글씨로 꾹꾹 눌러 쓴 이름이 가득 적혀 있습니다.
  세이프티, 켈베로스, 바닐라... 그리고 레프리콘.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_PECS_BlindPrincess_5: |-
  "눈에는 눈... 즉, 제 눈이 안 보이니까, 상대방도 눈을 못 뜨게 만들면 된다는 얘기죠!"
  "...그런 이야기는 절대 아니라고 생각한다, 성녀인 짐이여."
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Brunhild_1: >-
  허공에 불을 발생시키는 건 유에서 무를 창조하는 일이나 마찬가지였습니다.

  만에 하나, 발화능력을 갖게 됐다 해도 치명적인 위력을 지녔는지는 또 다른 문제였죠. 이를 보완하기 위해 제작된 것이 룬 문자를 상형화한 '레바테인'입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Brunhild_2: |-
  브륀힐드의 발화능력을 증폭시키는 '레바테인',
  촉매가 되어 강렬한 불길을 일으키는 '가름’. 
  모두, 한 사람이 브륀힐드를 위해 만들어 줬습니다.
  그녀의 머리색과 잘 어울릴 거라면서요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Brunhild_3: |-
  인간들이 투쟁을 위해 만들어 낸 그녀는 
  역설적이게도 인간들이 없는 세계에서 자신의 우수성을 증명했습니다.
  생존으로요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Brunhild_4: |-
  연구소의 성공 사례를 인격적으로 대한 인간은 한 명밖에 없었습니다.
  착하다기보다는 특이한 사람이었는데요. 
  브륀힐드가 자아를 갖게 된 계기는, 삼안 특작부대에 의해
  한 여성 연구원의 결혼식이 영영 이뤄지지 못하게 된 순간이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Brunhild_5: |-
  평상시에도 브륀힐드는 자신의 몸에 불길을 두르고 다닙니다.
  아무도 접근하지 못하게요. 
  언젠가는 그녀가 접근하는 걸 허락하는 사람이 나타나겠죠?
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hela_1: |-
  헬라는 나노머신을 통해 AGS의 잔해를 조종할 수 있습니다.
  멀쩡히 가동되고 있는 AGS는 조종할 수 없으니, 걱정하지 마세요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hela_2: |-
  헬라의 나노머신은 철충의 기계 감염 능력을 모방해 만들어졌습니다.
  물론, 철충의 감염 능력을 정확히 파악하지 못했기에,
  철충의 그것과는 완전히 다른 원리를 가지고 있지만요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hela_3: |-
  헬라의 이중인격은 헬라를 만든 학자들이 일부러 집어넣은 결점입니다.
  능력을 좀 더 파괴적으로 운용할 수 있도록,
  잔혹하고 무시무시한 버전의 인격... 일명 여신 헬라를 만들어냈지요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hela_4: |-
  북유럽 신화의 여신 헬라는 손톱으로 만든 배인 나글파르에 타고 죽은 자들의 군대를 이끈다고 합니다.
  당신의 헬라도 비슷하지만, 그녀는 유령을 무서워하기 때문에...
  당분간 죽은 자들의 군대를 이끌 생각은 없다고 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_BR_Hela_5: |-
  헤임은 집이라는 뜻을 가진 단어입니다.
  그러니, 헬헤임은 헬의 집이라는 뜻이지요.
  헬라의 집이었던 연구소는 고통스러운 비명으로 가득찬 곳이었기에, 헬라는 집이라는 단어에 그리 긍정적인 기억을 가지고 있지 않습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Melite_1: |-
  미사일 순양함에 탑재된 3연장포 2문은 보조 공격 수단에 불과했지만, 
  세계를 점령하기 위해 강력한 무기가 필요하다는 멜리테의 요청으로 
  고화력을 뿜어낼 수 있게 개조됐습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Melite_2: |-
  "초코랜드 여왕의 앞길을 막는 자, 용서치 않겠다!" ...는 앙증맞은 경고와 달리, 
  이어지는 미사일 세례는 가공할 위력으로 타격권 내의 모든 걸 분쇄해버립니다. 바다가 갈라질 정도니... 동맹으로서 든든하군요!
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Melite_3: 곁에서 호위하는 근위대(라고 멜리테는 주장하지만 같은 오르카 호 동료들입니다)의 수에 따라서 멜리테가 의기양양해집니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Melite_4: |-
  자칭 초코랜드의 여왕인 멜리테는 오늘도 인재 등용에 정신이 없습니다. 
  한아름 안은 사탕과 과자를 나눠주는 건 물론, 전장에서도 지원을 아끼지 않으며 대원들의 마음을 사기 위해 노력하고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Melite_5: |-
  홀로 바다를 표류하던 멜리테는 어느 날 손에 넣은 옛 동화의 내용을 
  자신의 사명으로 받아 들였습니다. 
  불행한 이들을 행복하게 만들기 위해, 누군가가 나라를 건국하고 
  왕위에 올라서야 한다면 기꺼이 자신이 그러하겠다고 굳게 다짐했죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Amphitrite_1: 오로지 화력에만 집중하는 살라시아와 달리, 엠피트리테는 화력 담당인 살라시아와
  달리, 지휘/통제 장비가 설치된 엠피트리테의 장비는 상대적으로 화력이 떨어지는 편입니다. 그런 약점을 보완하기 위해 개발된 특수 포탄은,
  명중한 적 함선의 전투 수행 능력을 급감시킵니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Amphitrite_2: 아무리 화력을 중시하지 않더라도, 전열에서 전투를 수행하는 엠피트리테의 역할상
  최소한의 화력은 필요했습니다. 이 탄환은 전자 교란 능력은 떨어지지만 훌륭한 화력으로 적을 저지할 수 있었고, 주로 돌발 행동을 하는 동생을
  지원하기 위해 사용되었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Amphitrite_3: 엠피트리테는 머메이드의 기동 분함대의 선봉에서 전술 지휘를 맡았습니다. 기존
  함선들을 아득히 능가하는 기동성과 저시인, 저피탄성은 머메이드 함대만이 가진 강점이었죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Amphitrite_4: 거친 바다 위에서 전장의 상황은 시시각각 변하기 마련. 아무리 좋은 전술이라도 때를 놓친다면 무용지물입니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Amphitrite_5: 아군과 적의 위치를 표시하는 레이더 화면은 엠피트리테의 시선이 가장 오래 머무는
  곳입니다. 그러면서도 특히 살라시아가 대형을 이탈해 이상한 곳으로 향하지 않는지 신경을 곤두세우곤 했죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Salacia_1: 혹시나 해서 말씀드리지만, 정식 명칭은 '펑펑 터지는 탄'이 아닙니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Salacia_2: 머메이드 소속 바이오로이드들이 사용하는 함포에는 특수하게 개발된 철갑 유탄이
  사용되었습니다. 덕분에 유효 사거리 내라면, 동급의 포세이돈, 호라이즌 함선에 대해 안정적인 관통을 보장할 수 있었죠. 물론, 이것도 '전부
  뚫는 탄'이 아닌 제대로 된 명칭이 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Salacia_3: 드넓은 바다에서 수십 km 바깥의 목표물을 명중시키는 것은 발전된 사격 통제 기술을
  활용하더라도 쉬운 일이 아닙니다. 그래도 목표와의 상대 위치를 유지하며 탄착점을 조절한다면 언젠가는 명중하게 되죠.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Salacia_4: 언뜻 마음대로 행동하는 것 같아 보이는 살라시아입니다만, 사실은 엠피트리테에게 굉장히 의지하고 있습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Salacia_5: 귀여운 외모와 아이 같은 행동 때문에 믿기 어렵지만, 후계기들이 개발되기 전까진 살라시아는 머메이드 함대 화력의 핵심이었습니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Galatea_1: |-
  MK12 양용포는 적의 항공기, 적의 전투함을 격퇴하는데 유용했습니다.
  덤으로 물고기를 잡을 때에도요.
  노파심에 말하지만 이 방법은 지역과 시대에 따라 불법이니 주의해주세요.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Galatea_2: |-
  누군가 말했습니다. 궁각은 더 이상 유효하지 않은 전술이라는 것을.
  하지만 갈라테아의 활약을 알게 되면 그들도 예외가 있다는 것을 인정할 수밖에 없을 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Galatea_3: |-
  갈라테아는 미숙한 면이 많습니다. 주어진 임무를 실패할 때도 있죠.
  하지만 동료를 지키는 것만큼은 무슨 일이 있어도 완수하려고 합니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Galatea_4: |-
  다목적 벌지를 갖춘 갈라테아를 쓰러트리기는 무척 힘들 겁니다.
  그리고 동료들을 지키려는 갈라테아의 마음을 꺾는 것은 불가능할 겁니다.
UNIT_SKILL_FLAVOR_3P_Galatea_5: >-
  때로는 거대한 전함이나 항공모함이 아닌, 용감한 구축함이 전황을 바꿀 수 있습니다.

  HMS 글로우웜과 USS 존스턴의 선례는 갈라테아에게 깊은 인상을 주었습니다. 그리고 그 결과 갈라테아는 연합 전쟁에서 전설적인 선배들이 보기에 부끄럽지 않은 활약을 펼쳤습니다.

  We should be careful. It’s Nest, the expert connector. I'll report the

  First, Nest shoots out combat machines from the body's CAD and sends enormous power to those machines.


  Second, if the body continues to be attacked, it deploys a barrier on its own.


  Third, it became weak temporarily when the ejected machine was destroyed while the barrier was deployed. And it seems that some weapon systems become unstable when they are attacked by elements.


  That's all I got for now. It’ll be pretty much difficult battle. Commander, please take the lead.

ENEMY_INTRO_Nest_EW: >-
  We should be careful. It’s Nest, the expert connector. I'll report the
  information obtained from the battle.


  First, Nest shoots out combat machines from the body's CAD and sends enormous power to those machines.


  Second, if the body continues to be attacked, it deploys a barrier on its own.


  Third, it became weak temporarily when the ejected machine was destroyed while the barrier was deployed. And it seems that some weapon systems become unstable when they are attacked by elements.


  That's all I got for now. It’ll be pretty much difficult battle. Commander, please take the lead.

  We should be careful. It’s Nest, the expert connector. I'll report the

  First, Nest shoots out combat machines from the body's CAD and sends enormous power to those machines.


  Second, if the body continues to be attacked, it deploys a barrier on its own.


  Third, it became weak temporarily when the ejected machine was destroyed while the barrier was deployed. And it seems that some weapon systems become unstable when they are attacked by elements.


  That's all I got for now. It’ll be pretty much difficult battle. Commander, please take the lead.

  I’ve prepared a healthy lunch and a Valentines Day gift for you, Commander. I hope you would like it.

  Now I’m going to go have fun with Xenox, Tiamat, Hunter, Raven, Pani, and the Captain. I actually wanted to go out with you and tell you a secret, but… I’ll tell you about it next time.

  See you later!

  I heard that you are relaxing, these days. It’s too bad that Horizon team is so busy these days. Well, we’ve prepared a small gift for you, Commander.


  Well, Joyeux Noel, Commander. We’ll see you soon in the Cafe we will be opening.​



  P.S. I’m not going to put it on my body, like to last time. This time it’s really well made dessert.​

  But if you really want it like that… then I’ll think about it.​
