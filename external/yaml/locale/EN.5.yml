  Hello Commander. In the old days, humans used to give gifts of chocolate
  coated sticks and cookies.

  So Alvis sneaked out in search of chocolates to make some chocolate cookies for you.

  But someone has already taken all the chocolates! So instead of chocolates, I got bunch of candies… but on my way back to the base… I ate all the candies! Ha, ha!

  But I’ll give you all the resources I brought back, okay?
CONSUMABLE_DESC_CharLetter_Char_BR_Miho_N_1: >-
  Commander! I heard that humans used to give gifts of chocolate coated cookies
  on November 11.

  I wondered maybe my Commander would want it also, so I searched for cookies that looked like a stick. I found a lots of chocolate, but I couldn’t find any cookies.

  So here it is. Chocolate for you!

  I’ve melted and remade it. So pretend to like it… even if it doesn’t taste so good?


  PS. I’ll send over 1 really well made chocolate separately, later on. It will be the best chocolate ever!

  I heard that today is the day for giving chocolate as a gift. So I went out looking for it with Hunter.

  But I couldn’t find any… sorry. There were only candies.

  So let’s go looking for chocolate together. I’ll let you ride the Xenox. I want to hear more of the story you were telling me before.

  Hello, Commander! I wanted to give this to you in person, but I never get the

  But at least I know that you are a very likeable person. I first thought you were weird but after seeing how other girls behave around you… I think I know, now.

  But still… remember the last time? That day when you were on a vacation? No, no! It’s not that I didn’t like it. No… but I was so surprised and embarrassed… That’s why I ran away. I hope you will not misunderstand me.


  I want to write more but the chef is calling. Speaking of which, I think the chef is acting weird these days. She became very nice… and it’s nice… but she sometimes daydreams or gets angry while cooking.
